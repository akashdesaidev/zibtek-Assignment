      "content": "Practical Agile Development Services Our Software Development Process Request Information Select Inquiry Type Submit now Our Software Development Process What is a practical agile approach to software development? At Zibtek , it's a combination of: High-Trust, Self-Organized Teams Who Understand Specific Business Needs. Principles And Practices That Can Easily Be Combined With A Variety Of Approaches. Staying Focused On The Rapid Development And Deployment Of Software. At Zibtek, good software development starts with a great idea. From concept to solution, we work with you to plan, develop, test, deliver, and assess your software needs. Our practical approach transforms the agile process from a mystifying undertaking to one where transparency and communication keep our clients happy! Pre-Project Consultation Preventing failure during the software development process begins with avoiding failure in the planning stage. Each project starts with a solid strategy used to build out a complete proposal and becomes the launch point for development. To determine your goals and objectives, we consult with you to better understand what you do and what you want to accomplish. Assess Fit Are we the right cultural fit for each other? Can we deliver the product you want and deserve? Refine Idea We ask questions—lots of questions! We want to fully understand your technology roadmap and validate your assumptions. Budget We work with you to establish a responsible budget that incorporates a comprehensive plan. We then build a proposal within the agreed-upon budget. “Our Client's Core Business Objective Always Stay At The Heart Of Everything We Do.“ - Cache Merrill Founder & CEO Strategy Based on budget and schedule requirements, as well as team availability, we build a project plan. It starts with using your core business objectives to outline a high-level plan that achieves your goals and removes as much uncertainty as possible. We define: The nature of the project and its inherent challenges. How we'll deal with those challenges. Which additional actions or are needed to execute the plan. Project Ideation Understanding your business goals is at the core of what we do. Every software development project starts with a central idea—a “problem statement” that drives the conversation. Before moving forward, we make sure we understand all: Actionable objectives Deliverables & Tasks Priorities Research A good business plan is only worth the results it delivers! If the plan isn’t doable, the work isn’t worth doing, either. Our project team meets with your stakeholders to discuss how to achieve your strategic goals. We define specific functionalities required by users. Conduct research and consult third-party vendors when necessary. This step should give you a clear vision of the end product, its target audience, and how the initial plan will guide the project. Design & Architecture This is where the end product’s look, feel, and function come into focus on : This is where the end product’s look, feel, and function come into focus. Review designs with our engineering team every week. Determine best-fit software development architecture. Already have designs? No problem! We’ll evaluate them for completeness and make sure all the required functionality’s in place. Our in-house design team has you covered! Planning Once core objectives are confirmed, we: Define Key components of delivery Identify internal resources that best fit your process Indicate major features and dependencies Share requirements with the broader team to make objectives clear. Wireframes, Prototyping, PoC, and Testing Our team includes UX designers who understand the critical importance of creating visually compelling and user-friendly experiences. We work closely with you to: Leverage powerful tools and clear processes to build the desired user experience, starting with wireframes and prototypes. Run a PoC to validate ideas and mitigate risks before full development. Incorporate feedback during PoC and prototyping to make informed decisions before investing in the final application. Architecture There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to software development. Different needs call for individual technologies. Our deep experience with a diverse range of technologies helps us: Assess the technology’s long-term viability for a given project. Determine if the best decision is choosing stability and cost over new and unproven. Assess the feasibility of using one technology over another. A senior tech lead with extensive industry experience guides this stage, shaping the software's functionality and architecture. Development With a clear vision for design and functionality, a call is initiated with you, the project manager, and the developers. Objectives are restated. Communication methods are confirmed. Each engineering team is paired with a senior tech lead and project manager. All Zibtek projects are supervised by the solutions architect, so you’re never without support if an issue arises. Our tech leads have eight to fifteen years of experience and, to ensure quality stays high, are limited to a set number of projects at any given time. Agile Development To drive superior results for our clients, the majority of our projects employ a practical agile methodology . In an agile process, the team’s efficiency closely correlates with how much visibility and structure the project manager has. Communications Quality, consistent communications throughout a project’s lifecycle ensure your needs and expectations are met. Big or small, every team and each member reports daily on their activity. Project and delivery managers drive internal and external communication to bridge the divide between technical and non-technical resources With their structured standup, consistent evaluation, peer code reviews, and rapid issue resolution, sprints are a continuous improvement approach that keeps you engaged in every step of the process. You can regularly review the progress of your software development and provide feedback. - Share daily written status updates. - Track individual engineer tasks. - Resolve bugs. - Access to shared documents and files. Sprints We work in sprints which are small, targeted allotments of development time that allow engineers to solve problems more collaboratively. The key benefits offered by sprints’ structured flexibility include: Measured adaptation to change. Incorporation of new ideas. Improve project predictability. Better control & Superior quality product. With their structured standup, consistent evaluation, peer code reviews , and rapid issue resolution, sprints are a continuous improvement approach that keeps you engaged in every step of the process. You can regularly review the progress of your software development and provide feedback. Launch From server setup to data storage and deployment, we support your team through launch. And if your software application requires deployment to the app store, we handle that, too! Deployment Planning We support your team from setup to launch, automating testing and enabling real-time progress tracking in a client-facing environment for a smooth, high-quality product rollout. Planning When called for, we: Automate deployments. Structure development ecosystems to be scalable. The goal is to automate testing of features to ensure operability once new code is added. Project managers and in-house QA engineers review user stories (informal, general explanations of software features) before the work reaches production. Deployment During the development process we set up multiple environments that allow team members to: Deploy quickly. Show you everything that’s happening. Showing work results in a client-facing development environment helps identify visual and technical issues more quickly, which results in a better product. Launch It’s launch time! We work with you to: Mitigate launch risks. Plan resources around hyper-care and prep infrastructure as appropriate. Moving forward, we accept feedback and keep you flexible as your business grows by: Structuring new feature rollouts. Handling support inquiries. Tackling new features required by your users.

Beyond creating new revenue streams and cutting costs, CIOs can help PE-funded companies enter new markets, he says. Hats, Villages, and Failures: Report Reveals the Shared Experiences of Entrepreneurs \"It takes a village to build a successful business. No entrepreneur succeeds in isolation,\" says Cache Merrill, founder of Zibtek, a custom software development company. \"Our village includes dedicated management team members, supportive mentors, and a network of industry peers. Collaborative efforts and diverse insights have been pivotal in helping us navigate challenges and spark innovations with our operations.\" More Publishers Take Aim at OpenAI: Is There a Solution to AI News? \"The legality of scraping for LLM training is currently a gray area in copyright law. It largely depends on the jurisdiction and specific legal frameworks concerning fair use and copyright exceptions, which are now being challenged by these lawsuits\" The outcome of this lawsuit could set a significant legal precedent for how data is used in training Al. It's likely that we will see either stricter regulations emerge or a push towards more transparent and compensatory models for data usage in Al. says Cache Merrill, CEO at Zibtek. The Mutual Benefits of Employee Volunter Programs: A Win-win For Employers and Employees \"In today's socially conscious environment, more companies are recognizing the value of encouraging their employees to engage in volunteer programs. Such initiatives not only contribute to the community and the greater good but also offer tangible benefits to both employers and employees\". At Zibtek we started an initiative called Geeks For Good to encourage our employees to participate and give back inside their communities. We have had several exciting and fun initiatives over the years. We have seen how volunteer programs can be a win-win, enhancing company culture, boosting employee morale, and even improving business performance. Cache Merrill, CEO at Zibtek. How To Develop Your Business’ Technology Roadmap \"When people have an idea for a piece of software or an app, they tend to be pretty energized about getting it to market as quickly as possible. It's exciting to create an app or piece of software no one's ever imagined or built before. As software developers, we're usually right there with them\" Says Cache Merrill, CEO at Zibtek. Is GPT-5 on the Horizon? Experts Ponder OpenAI’s Next Chatbot Possibilities For commerce, the implications of a more advanced LLM (large language model) like GPT-5 are vast,\" Cache Merrill, the founder and CTO of Zibtek, an Al-based software company, told PYMNTS. \"We could see significant improvements in customer service bots, offering more coherent and contextually appropriate interactions without human intervention. In digital marketing, content generation could become more sophisticated and tailored, enhancing engagement strategies. How to fly a drone and land it in one piece like a professional \"Even if your drone weighs less than 250 grams, though, there are some basic rules that all drone operators should follow\" Cache Merrill, drone enthusiast and chief treasury officer for the IT and drone custom software developer Zibtek, suggests always keeping the drone within your line of sight, ensuring the airspace is free of other aircraft or restricted areas and never flying over groups of people or public events. Now the iPad Will Get Alternate App Stores, Too!! \"I believe the iPad, with its larger screen and more powerful capabilities compared to the iPhone, stands to benefit immensely from this increased flexibility. This could address a longstanding critique of the iPad ecosystem that it does not fully utilize its hardware capabilities due to software limitations\" by Cache Merrill, CEO at Zibtek. Personalized pricing’ means the price isn’t the same for everyone The concept is called \"personalized pricing\" and corporate America is beginning to adopt it. It's the same as when a handyman gives you a quote for doing a household job. He might look at your car, your house, your haircut and the way you're dressed to determine what you might be willing and able to pay. With personalized pricing, the handyman has access to a lot more data about you he has scraped from the internet. Cache Merrill, the founder and CTO of Zibtek, a software development company, says artificial intelligence (AI) makes personalized pricing even more effective. He think consumers are going to see more of it. Skip the Boring Business Plan. Focus on This Strategy Instead. \"As a startup, you are in a race to deliver customer value. Sinking time into writing out a business plan a plan that you probably won't be able to stick to can be a tremendous waste of time. You can get all of the benefits of a business plan on one page, and this will help you discover the two or three things that matter most today\" Says Cache Merrill, CEO at Zibtek.

The Most Important Web Development Trends in 2020 \"Web development is evolving as users increasingly rely on mobile and voice searches. Companies must focus on high-quality content over keyword-heavy pages due to Al advancements like Google's RankBrain. With rising mobile traffic and voice search, optimizing for mobile and conversational keywords is crucial. Cybersecurity remains a top priority, with businesses investing heavily in protecting data amid new technological developments like 5G\" Says Cache Merrill, CEO at Zibtek. How to keep up with the ever-evolving world of technology in the modern era \"Throughout business technology landscapes we have seen major changes in technology just over the past ten years\" Here are a few examples: we have seen major changes in online purchasing, with Amazon leading the way in easy purchasing, fast delivery, and quick refunds. We have also seen significant changes in business tools around CRM, workflow, and business mobile apps along with infrastructure performance enhancements moving to 5g mobile internet. Also most recently, with tools like ChatGPT, we continue to see incredible innovation worldwide in how businesses operate..\" says Cache Merrill Founder @ Zibtek. 8 cloud security gotchas most CISOs miss “The temporary aspect of ephemeral resources might lead security teams to underestimate the potential security risks, assuming these resources pose less of a threat due to their short lifespan,” says Cache Merrill, founder of software vendor Zibtek.

      "content": "Supercharge Your Web Apps with Zibtek’s Next.js Expertise At Zibtek, Next.js is not just another framework, but a blueprint for crafting scalable, lightning‑fast, and SEO‑forward digital experiences. We leverage Next.js SSR (server‑side rendering) and hybrid rendering to deliver fully formed HTML on each request, ensuring instant paint times for users and search engines alike. Elevate Your Website using Next.js What is Next.js? (The Future of High‑Performance Web Apps) Next.js is a leading React framework for building robust full‑stack applications. With features like server side rendering, static site generation, and automatic static optimization, it empowers developers to craft apps that are fast, flexible, and SEO‑friendly. Why Next.js Stands Out Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Dynamic Rendering • By pre-rendering pages on the server and delivering them as complete HTML, the initial load time is reduced, enhancing the user experience. For content that changes based on individual users or specific requests, dynamic rendering ensures personalized data is provided in real-time. Static Site Generation (SSG) & Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) • Next.js implements static site generation (SSG) to pre‑render pages at build time, delivering exceptionally fast load speeds. Its incremental static regeneration (ISR) capability then allows individual pages to be refreshed on demand—without a full rebuild—so sites stay both performant and up‑to‑date. File‑Based Routing & Dynamic Routes • Next.js’s file based routing means your directory structure defines your URLs—no extra config. Its Next.js routing system, one of the most intuitive file routing frameworks, also supports dynamic routes so pages adapt to different data sets without redundant templates. API Routes & Serverless Functions • With Next.js API routes, you can create serverless functions and API endpoints right alongside your frontend code—no separate server needed. This simplifies data handling, form submissions, and third‑party integrations within a single project. Built‑In Image Optimization • Our use of the next/image component brings automatic Next.js image optimization—serving responsive images in modern formats and lazy loading images as they enter the viewport, ensuring faster LCP times across devices. Client Benefits: Why Next.js Delivers Business Value Blazing Performance: Combining SSR, static rendering, and SSG reduces load times and server strain. SEO Advantage: Pre‑rendered pages and semantic markup improve crawlability and rankings. Seamless Navigation: File‑based routing and smart prefetching create fluid, app‑like experiences. Future‑Ready Scalability: Incremental updates via ISR allow your site to grow without extensive rebuilds. TypeScript Integration: Building Robust, Scalable Apps Integrating TypeScript with Next.js enhances the development experience by providing static typing, which helps catch errors at compile time and improves code quality. Benefits include: Type Safety: Ensures variables and functions are used as intended, reducing runtime errors. Enhanced Tooling: Improves IDE support with autocompletion and refactoring tools. Improved Maintainability: Facilitates easier code management in larger codebases. Early Error Detection: Identifies potential issues during development, saving time in debugging. By adopting TypeScript, businesses can build more reliable and maintainable applications, leading to better user experiences and reduced long-term development costs. Why Choose Zibtek for Your Next.js Development Services? Full‑Stack Capability: From custom UI/UX to Next.js API integrations, we own every layer—delivering cohesive, high‑performance solutions without handoff delays. Performance & SEO Focus: We bake in SSR, SSG/ISR, structured data, and Core Web Vitals optimizations to elevate your site’s speed and visibility. TypeScript Mastery: Our code is strongly typed and maintainable—minimizing bugs and ensuring long‑term agility. Agile, Transparent Process: We follow agile methodology—blending Scrum ceremonies and Kanban agile boards for continuous delivery and clear communication. Our Next.js Development Process 🔎 Discovery & Planning Collaborative workshops to align on business goals, user needs, and technical strategy. 🖌️ Architecture & Design Define scalable component libraries, Next.js TypeScript interfaces, and API contracts. 🧑🏻‍🔧 Implementation & Integration Leverage SSR, SSG/ISR, dynamic rendering, and Next.js routing to build performant, accessible UIs. ✅ Quality Assurance Automated tests, Lighthouse performance audits, and security scans ensure rock-solid releases. 👩🏻‍💻 Deployment & Monitoring CI/CD pipelines to Vercel, AWS, or your chosen platform—paired with real-time monitoring. 🎗️ Ongoing Support Continuous updates, performance tuning, and feature enhancements to evolve with your business. Success Stories & Case Studies Client: Zack Academy Objective: Revamp the UI, boost performance, and deliver a faster, more engaging user experience. The Challenge Zack Academy’s site suffered from an outdated interface, slow page loads, and limited SEO visibility, which hampered both user engagement and organic traffic. The Next.js–Powered Solution Zibtek led a full rebuild on Next.js, leveraging its core strengths: Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Employed Next.js SSR to generate fully formed HTML on each request, improving first-paint times for users and ensuring search engines index complete content. File-Based & Dynamic Routing: Adopted Next.js’s file-system router for intuitive URLs, with dynamic routes to handle course pages and custom parameters seamlessly. Image Optimization & Lazy Loading: Replaced standard <img> tags with the next/image component to serve responsive, modern-format images and lazy-load them as they enter the viewport—boosting render performance. Qualitative Outcomes Faster Load Times: Users experience near‑instant page rendering and smoother navigation. Improved SEO: Complete HTML delivery, structured metadata, and clear URL structures support better search indexing. Modern UX: A refreshed UI with responsive design and fluid routing elevates user engagement.

At Zibtek, we specialize in crafting scalable, secure, and user-centric ecommerce solutions tailored to your business needs.​ Unlock your Online Potential Many retailers hit walls without robust ecommerce web development services, causing integration mismatches between storefronts, ERPs, and CRMs that frustrate teams and customers alike. Traffic surges can overwhelm infrastructure, causing slow load times and lost sales. Poor scalability and mobile responsiveness further hinder user experience, increasing bounce rates and cart abandonment. Security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps expose businesses to data breaches and reputational damage. Zibtek’s expert ecommerce web developers deliver seamless performance, reliable integrations, and airtight security—transforming these challenges into growth opportunities. Our Services ✦ Custom Ecommerce Development: Custom Storefront Development: We build bespoke storefronts through custom ecommerce website development. Our ecommerce developers use React.js or Angular single-page applications to achieve WCAG 2.1 accessibility and a Lighthouse performance score over 90. UI/UX & Conversion Optimization: By leveraging data insights to enhance navigation, trust signals, and mobile responsiveness, we help clients increase conversion rates by at least 20%. Integrations & Migration Third-Party Integrations: Our ecommerce developers connect ERPs, CRMs, PIMs, and payment gateways via REST or GraphQL APIs, with full OpenAPI specs and secure OAuth2/JWT authentication. Platform Implementation & Migration: We migrate data, URLs, and meta-tags from legacy platforms to Shopify, Magento, Drupal, or WordPress with zero SEO loss and under one hour of scheduled downtime. Performance & Security Performance & Scalability Engineering: As part of our ecommerce development services, Zibtek architects auto-scaling Kubernetes clusters, integrates global CDNs, and performs rigorous load testing to ensure resilience under heavy user demand. Security & Compliance Hardening: We enforce TLS 1.2+, AES-256 at rest, PCI DSS Level 1 compliance. Our ecommerce software solutions also include GDPR/CCPA workflows, and quarterly OWASP Top 10 audits to protect data and privacy. API-First Commerce & Mobile Engagement Headless Commerce & PWA: Leveraging API-first architectures, we decouple front- and back-ends, implement service workers for offline browsing, and integrate headless CMS platforms like Contentful or Strapi. Mobile Ecommerce App Development: Our native (Swift/Kotlin) or React Native apps feature offline catalog caching, secure authentication, and segment-based push notifications through Firebase. Analytics & Support Analytics, Personalization & A/B Testing: We deploy GA4 with server-side tagging, enable ML-driven recommendations, and run A/B tests via Optimizely for continuous conversion optimization. Ongoing Maintenance & Support: With reliable uptime guarantees, rapid incident response, proactive monitoring through New Relic, and regular dependency patching, we ensure your store stays secure and high-performing. Our Process: Agile-Powered Ecommerce Development We leverage Agile methodologies to deliver custom ecommerce development projects—characterized by iterative sprints, continuous feedback, and adaptive planning—ensuring excellence in our ecommerce web development services. Discovery & Sprint Planning We kick off with collaborative workshops and backlog creation, refining user stories that capture business goals, target audiences, and competitive insights. During sprint planning, we prioritize features into two-week iterations, ensuring clear KPIs and technical requirements guide each sprint. Design & Iteration Our UI/UX team works in design sprints to build wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes. We hold regular design reviews and incorporate stakeholder and user feedback within each sprint cycle to optimize user journeys and conversion paths. Development & Continuous Integration Using Scrum or Kanban, our ecommerce developers build custom themes, REST/GraphQL APIs, and payment integrations in short, focused sprints, following best practices in ecommerce web development services. QA, Testing & Sprint Reviews Each sprint concludes with automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, alongside manual accessibility (WCAG) and security compliance checks. Sprint reviews showcase working increments to stakeholders, ensuring transparency and alignment before proceeding. Deployment & Release Planning As part of our custom ecommerce development approach, we employ continuous deployment practices for incremental releases, ensuring stability through zero-downtime deployment strategies and rollback mechanisms. Monitoring, Retrospectives & Ongoing Support Post-launch, we monitor performance and user metrics in real time (New Relic dashboards), then conduct sprint retrospectives to capture lessons learned. Our SLA-backed support, rapid incident response, and backlog grooming ensure the platform evolves in line with business needs.

You get the most bang for your investment and a product end-users love. How to have a successful software launch. If it’s to succeed, a Practical Agile process requires good communication, clear requirements, and detailed planning.

      "title": "Kickoff Meeting: Best Way to Kick off a new Software Project",
      "content": "So, you are sitting in your office and have an idea for great new tool that could help your company drive efficiency. Now what? Even experienced product owners understand that launching a new software project can be riddled with challenges. As I guy who has sold tons of software projects and seen many fall flat, let me share with you the recipe that has led to our most successful engagements. The Project Kickoff Meeting Often clients come to us with nothing more than an idea. We prepare them with the kickoff meeting. Our client services team at Zitbek has to work with that client to extract the idea from our clients minds and convert it to features and functionality. Here is a list of the questions we ask: · What is the core problem you are trying to solve? · Are there similar applications in the market today? · What do they specifically lack and why? · Is it a web or mobile app? · How many different types of users / people will be using this application? After gaining a sense of the spirit of the application, the team at Zibtek works towards mapping out the flow of the application. Here is an example of what that looks like: Cheapest way to ideate is in design. Often the creation of the UI/UX is where to software starts to become real. Oftentimes with new projects the initial design session is where they real think their application. Visually seeing how users are going to use their tool to solve problems creates an environment that challenges their idea and encourages the new product owner to think through even the smallest of details. It all starts with the user journey. Let’s say that were creating Uber. Well we would identify that there are going to be at least 3 types of users. Passengers, Drivers and Uber. At Zibtek we start with one of these users like Passengers for example. The designer would sit with the client and flush out everything a passenger would need to see or click in order to get a ride. Once that process is finished, you repeat with the Driver and Uber roles. One of the most often forgotten portions of application development is creating that admin role. It is critical to almost all functionality of an application especially monetization! The compellation of all of these efforts is displayed as a Wire Frame. It’s all about the planning. After the designs are finalized, it can seem like the most of the work is done. Unfortunately, the work has just begun. For engineers to truly understand how to build your application the way you have visualized is to put together a planning strategy or document in a tool like Clickup. Clickup allows project managers to breakdown core functionality in to bite sizes pieces. These pieces are usually referred to as tickets. Each ticket / functionality has to be planned by 1 st defining the user story. Define User Stories · I – Independent · N – Negotiable · V – Valuable · E – Estimable · S – Small · T – Testable Once user stories have been written, acceptance criteria (AC) for each of those user stories must be established. AC’s are critical because they are used to make the decision is a feature is complete. Defining success is often lost on many projects and why scope creep is a popular term. One the most critical part of the planning process is determining the most effective tech stack. Probably one of the biggest differences between Zibtek in other development companies is that we have a “Product First” initiative. Zibtek believes in selecting the best technology for the problem, not selecting the technology we have the most experience in like other firms. Communication is key in principle engineering. The costliest part of the software building process is principle engineering. Which means it is the part as a client you want to be as close to as possible. The difference between a successful build and an expensive never-ending project is usually directly linked to how responsive the client is during the engineering process. The software build uses an Agile approach in which is work is broken down in to 2 weeks sprints. These sprints are utilized to create a measuring stick for progress. Evaluating the amount of productivity that happens in a 2-week period greatly helps in planning out an entire build. This model combined with continuous delivery (Continuous delivery pipeline is an implementation of the continuous paradigm, where automated builds, tests and deployments are orchestrated as one release workflow) allows Zibtek to get our clients functioning code as quickly as possible so they can provide feedback and test. Client communication during the sprint process is necessary as engineering priorities can often change as work proves out to be easier or more complicated then originally estimated. Decisions need to be made in order to keep the team productive. Define Success. One of the biggest contributors to scope creep is a moving goal post. If the target constantly changes, it will never get hit. Proper planning and communications provide the environment needed to define success in aver specific way. That definition will set clear expectations for both the engineers and the product owners. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

      "title": "Agile Software Development: Restore Balance to the Manifesto",
      "content": "After 25 years of experience, 3 acquisitions, and over 300 products, we have decided to share some of the knowledge we have gained from working in this industry. Agile Software Development The software development industry is accelerating at a rapid pace, therefore we thought it would be beneficial to provide not just one blog post about agile software development, but a whole series regarding a practical approach to the agile method and how our company has benefited from implementing these agile practices. From Zibtek to your company, we hope you can take away something valuable from this new blog post series that will help you have success in your endeavors. If you have any questions concerning any information in these posts, please feel free to reach out to us . When was the Agile Manifesto developed? In 2001, a group of 17 men gathered together in Snowbird Utah to ski, talk, and discuss the future of software development. From this meeting, the Agile Manifesto emerged, thus implementing this style of development across the world. The message is short, simple, and emphasizes the importance of valuing human connection in the industry. The manifesto encompasses these four main points: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan The Problems in Agile Style of Software Development As the agile style of software development has become popular in the past 20 years, the method has evolved into an extreme. It seems that companies are replacing the word “over” with “instead of” in the manifesto. For example, some businesses are approaching the agile method as valuing individuals and interactions instead of processes and tools or responding to change instead of following a plan. While individual interaction and responding to change is vital, these ideas can’t replace what creates structure in the company. Like in all elements of life, actions need to be performed in moderation. The Agile method of software development has been taken to an extreme that has created a negative context associated with the word. In the manifesto, underneath the “History” tab it states, “The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact, many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. We want to restore a balance.” The keyword in this statement is “balance”. The purpose of this agile style of software development was never meant to be a replacement of focus, but a re-emphasis of methods. Agile Manifesto for Software Development The “Rename” At Zibtek, we have strived to restore balance to the use of the agile method. To emphasize this change, we often describe our process as “practical agile”. We strongly and genuinely implement the human connection that is highlighted in the manifesto, but on the other hand, we value efficiency and productivity, therefore we haven’t eliminated processes, tools, and documentation. Through “practical agile” we have introduced a balance that promotes the results that ultimately the agile method was designed to produce back in 2001. Agile Software Development Agile Software Development Methods Through this series of blog posts, we will describe how Zibtek implements a “practical agile” method of software development in our process as well as the results that have derived from this shift. If you have any questions regarding our software development services or how we utilize a \"practical agile\" method within our company feel free to reach out to us.

      "title": "Unlock Staff Augmentation with Zibtek",
      "content": "Imagine this: You're two weeks away from a major product launch. Your internal team is stretched thin, your roadmap includes a critical cloud-native microservices integration and an advanced security audit, and there’s simply no time to recruit, onboard, and train new hires from scratch. Traditional hiring timelines—often measured in months—threaten your go-live date. Meanwhile, generic consulting engagements can deliver recommendations but leave execution gaps. Enter Zibtek’s staff augmentation —a flexible, on-demand model that embeds pre-vetted experts directly into your team to close skill gaps, accelerate delivery, and control costs without long-term commitments. Staff Augmentation Meaning and Models What Is Staff Augmentation? Staff augmentation is the strategic practice of supplementing your internal workforce with external professionals or contractors for defined periods and projects. The primary goal is to fill precise skill gaps—whether in software development, cybersecurity, or data science—without altering your organizational hierarchy or making permanent hires. This model allows companies to swiftly scale their capacity up or down, matching resource levels to project demands and avoiding the delays of traditional recruitment cycles. Globally, the staffing industry—which underpins much of the staff augmentation market—is estimated to support nearly $650 billion in annual spend, reflecting the widespread adoption of contingent talent models across sectors. Staff Augmentation Meaning Often abbreviated as staff aug , this approach stands apart from full outsourcing by preserving internal management control. Augmented professionals report directly to your project leads, use your tools and methodologies, and integrate into your team culture—ensuring cohesion and consistency. Unlike purely “plug-and-play” outsourced teams, staff aug specialists function as extensions of your in-house staff: they attend stand-ups, participate in sprint planning, and adhere to your performance metrics . This hands-on integration minimizes communication friction and accelerates time to productivity, typically allowing experts to contribute meaningfully within one to two weeks of engagement. Staff Augmentation vs Consulting Where consulting engagements primarily provide strategic recommendations, staff augmentation delivers both strategy and execution. Consultants diagnose challenges, develop roadmaps, and often hand off plans, whereas augmented professionals embed in your sprint cycles to implement solutions directly. Consulting fees can be high, and project success may hinge on client-side execution; staff augmentation aligns cost-per-hour rates with deliverables, reducing the risk of “analysis paralysis” and ensuring accountability for implementation. Moreover, mixing consulting and augmentation can yield synergistic outcomes: consultants set the vision, and augmented teams bring it to life under a unified governance model. IT Staff Augmentation Companies The marketplace for staff augmentation companies includes generalist platforms (Upwork Enterprise, Toptal) and specialized firms (Zibtek, Modis, Accenture). Leading providers differentiate on three core dimensions: Vetting Rigor : Top firms conduct multi-stage interviews, live coding assessments, and reference checks to ensure technical mastery. Time-to-Match : Premier companies maintain talent pools that enable 1–2 week turnaround from request to candidate start date. Domain Focus : Firms with vertical expertise (fintech, healthcare, retail) offer specialists familiar with industry regulations, compliance standards, and best practices. Zibtek’s end-to-end process exemplifies these standards—combining automated skill assessments, cultural alignment interviews, and continuous performance reviews to achieve a 95% first-match success rate. Key Benefits of Staff Augmentation 1. Instant Access to Specialized Talent With staff augmentation, Zibtek clients tap into a curated global network of senior engineers, DevOps specialists, cybersecurity architects, data scientists, and more—professionals who start delivering value within days, not months. Unlike traditional consulting, where consultants advise but do not execute, our experts integrate into your existing workflows, attend daily stand-ups, write code in your repositories, and follow your sprint cadence. 2. Cost Efficiency and Predictable Budgeting Engaging talent through staff augmentation companies eliminates the hidden costs of full-time hires—salaries, benefits, equipment, recruitment fees, and office overhead. Zibtek customers report up to 85% cost savings compared to permanent staffing models, aligning with Deloitte’s finding that 47% of small businesses realize significant budget reductions by leveraging contingent experts. 3. Scalability and On-Demand Flexibility Business needs ebb and flow. Whether you require a single specialist for a proof-of-concept or a 10-member team for a full product sprint, staff aug scales up or down with zero friction. Gartner notes that 65% of organizations rank flexibility as their top driver for adopting staff augmentation, enabling rapid pivots and efficient resource utilization. 4. Accelerated Time to Market By bypassing protracted recruiting and onboarding, Zibtek’s augmented teams often cut project delivery timelines by 38%, according to PwC’s research comparing augmentation to traditional hires. Forrester further reports that companies leveraging staff augmentation strategies bring products to market 20% faster than peers relying solely on in-house teams. 5. Enhanced Risk Mitigation and Quality Assurance Augmented professionals arrive with domain-specific best practices, compliance certifications, and proven methodologies. In regulated industries—healthcare, finance, defense—this reduces audit failures and rework. Zibtek specialists hold industry certifications (CISSP, AWS/GCP/Azure Professional, PMP) and adhere to rigorous code-review processes, slashing defect rates by up to 50% in client engagements. Traditional Hiring vs. Staff Augmentation: A Simple Timeline When to Leverage Staff Augmentation Short-Term, High-Skill Projects Staff augmentation is perfect for short-term initiatives requiring niche expertise unavailable internally. Whether migrating legacy systems to the cloud, prototyping blockchain smart contracts in Solidity or Rust, or launching a Swift or Kotlin mobile feature, you get specialists who hit the ground running. This approach avoids lengthy recruitment cycles while ensuring you meet aggressive deadlines with confidence. Seasonal or Cyclical Workloads During peak seasons—like holiday e-commerce surges or end-of-quarter close-outs—you can onboard QA testers, database engineers, or support agents without the commitment of full-time hires. When demand subsides, simply scale back to your core team, avoiding underutilized staff and ongoing overhead. The same model works for fixed-term, grant-funded research, keeping operations lean yet fully resourced. Rapid Market Pivots When regulations change or new technologies emerge, staff augmentation lets you integrate specialists—GDPR/CCPA experts, edge-computing engineers, or IoT developers—within days. These professionals help you prototype, validate, and comply swiftly, maintaining momentum. By leveraging this flexible strategy, you stay ahead of competitors without the drag of traditional hiring. Scaling In-House Teams Alleviate burnout and prevent attrition by adding experts during crunch times. By embedding elite talent exactly when and where you need it, Zibtek’s staff augmentation offering empowers your organization to maintain project momentum, reduce costs, and de-risk critical initiatives—without the delays or overhead of traditional hiring. Whether you’re facing a looming deadline, embarking on a strategic pivot, or scaling for seasonal demand, staff augmentation delivers an agile , cost-effective solution. Drive Growth with On-Demand Staff Augmentation Rather than being held back by hiring delays or stretched resources, imagine having the precise skills you need arrive exactly when you need them—no guesswork, no overhead. Zibtek’s staff augmentation model delivers this promise, combining cost efficiency, specialized expertise, and operational agility to power projects of any scope—from short-term, high-impact initiatives to seasonal surges and strategic pivots. By embedding pre-vetted professionals directly into your workflows, you retain full managerial control, preserve cultural cohesion, and accelerate your path to value. Whether you’re executing a complex cloud migration, scaling for peak demand, or navigating new regulatory landscapes, Zibtek equips you to tackle every challenge with confidence. Ready to transform your team and future-proof your operations? Contact Zibtek today to explore tailored staff augmentation solutions that drive sustainable growth. How does staff augmentation differ from managed services? Managed services outsource entire operational domains—support desks, network ops—while staff augmentation embeds specialists into your existing teams under your governance. What criteria should I use to select an IT staff augmentation partner? Assess candidate vetting speed, technical assessment rigor, cultural alignment processes, and ongoing performance management—Zibtek’s 95% first-match rate and biweekly feedback loops set us apart.

      "content": "PROJECT INFORMATION Background Zinch is yet another company in the education technology space that we’ve loved working with. Zinch provides high school students with the resources they need to get into the college of their dreams by connecting them with college recruiters. Zinch worked with several teams both internally and using offshore developers to get its product built. Unfortunately, these teams were not hitting the mark. Challenge As a startup, Zinch knew that hiring the right talent was important, as custom software development tends to be expensive. Zinch tested several different channels while looking for developer talent but found none that were meeting expectations. The team tried to utilize local freelancers and engineers, but they were costly to employ for extended engagements. Zinch also tried working with other direct international developers from Ukraine and Vietnam and but had difficulty nailing down effectiveness with these outsourced teams. With investor funding and timeline dwindling, Zinch needed to get its product built quickly and done right the first time. Goals The overall goal for Zinch was to create an online portal for students to showcase themselves to admissions officers. This would lead to connections being made and scholarships being offered. Solution Having worked with international teams who stifled progress, Zinch knew that it needed to find the right developers to augment its team and get the product built quickly. After two weeks of Zibtek’s developer progress on the Zinch product, the team knew they had finally found the right tech partner. This new model allowing the Zinch team to communicate in clear English with a US-based tech lead was the piece that was missing in earlier partnerships. Outcome The Zinch product gained 3.5 million users before its acquisition by Chegg. This acquisition had lead to a huge expansion for Chegg by tripling its user base, increasing scholarship amounts to $1.9 billion, and adding over 5,000 school profiles to its existing list. Because quick product iterations were made for Zinch, it was able to find the perfect product market fit. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

Background Modular Store Fixture Products And Accessories OPTO International has been a leader in the retail design industry for more than 35 years. They supply display cases, shelving and storage materials for businesses. Through the years, the company has served clients in more than 20 countries. OPTO has succeeded as an industry leader by designing fixtures to match the latest trends in the market and their clients' unique needs. Manufacturing authentic fixture designs with the principles of quality, durability, flexibility, and innovation is their motto. OPTO works towards achieving this with each and every client they collaborate with. With their manufacturing base is in the United States, they construct fixtures from locally sourced materials of the highest quality.

Our Strategy How we work Create Our designers and architects work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow Sprint Receive product builds every two-week's as we add features Learn We analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features Problems The client's was taking orders manually and leveraging a written process for order and inventory management. Numerous off the shelf ERP solutions were evaluated but no single solution covered all of the business's needs. As a result, the firm decided to hire a custom software development services firm to build a custom web based ERP solution. Their marketing website was also stale and needed to be redesigned and re-launched. The design of a new application and redesign of the marketing website presented several UI and UX challenges. The product catalog had to be restructured in such a way that allowed both web locations to accurately reflected available products, their features and had the flexibility to add new products. To accommodate growth, the client needed a system that would help match customer orders with inventory management orders of supplies. Various client billing systems needed to be integrated into the tool to allow for a seamless experience for vendors and suppliers. The overarching objective was to consolidate as much manual work into the tool as possible. Solution As the company had no in-house engineering team, the client evaluated the top software development companies in the market and selected Zibtek. We designed the ERP system and revisited plans for the marketing website. Considerable time was spent on the architecture and user journey to align the website & content with their business requirements. Marketing automation functionality like lead capture was built into the application in order to further enhance the firm’s ability to streamline order and company data capture. We redefined the process for adding new content. Catalog changes were made seamless and structured to be responsive from the admin panel. Visually, the style sheet and content layout and structure were given a modern look.

      "title": "Cost of Software Development? Here are 6 Factors to Consider",
      "content": "The cost of software development comes up frequently in conversation. Hundreds, if not thousands of pieces of web applications are created each month. We’ve come a long way from specialized apps being the domain of large corporations with hefty budgets. Nearly any business can now benefit from a customized app . So, what’s holding many of them back? The cost of software development is a major concern. SMBs often lack the internal resources needed to build their apps and typically can’t afford to hire in-house engineers. Many consider outsourcing software development but still experience sticker shock upon receipt of the estimate. Let’s take a look at what drives the cost of software development. We’ll also discuss ways you can build a workable app within your price range. What Determines the Cost of Software Development? Custom software can increase company-wide efficiency, increase innovation, and help you reach new customers. So, it would seem like a pretty good long-term investment. But it’s the short-term companies think about most. How much you’ll need to spend in the present often makes it difficult to see the lasting benefits. Plus, because every project is unique, there’s no template to follow when pricing software development. A quick online search reveals hourly engineer costs of anywhere from $30 to $150 per hour and more. Estimated costs per application range from $20,000 to $150,000. Not very helpful, right? What might be more helpful is to take a “backward approach.” That simply means taking a look at the factors involved first to see if maybe there are ways to keep your costs lower. Schedule Time is a huge factor in estimating software costs. For instance, if you have a short deadline in mind, the development company will likely need to expand resources to accommodate your time constraints. Therefore, the more flexible you can be on delivery, the more you may save. Another cost-saving idea is to ask your internal team or a software consultant how long it would realistically take to build your app. You can then multiply this time by the average cost of engineers and come up with a rough idea of your total development costs. Just remember there are always non-development activities that affect the final price. 2. Team Skills Every project requires a business analyst, project manager, designers, developers, and testers. The size of a team depends on how complex the project is. What they’re paid is contingent on their experience level. If your project is complex, but you decide to hire as few people as possible to save money, you’ll likely end up paying more as the project will take much longer to complete. 3. Scope/Product Complexity Project requirements are directly proportional to software costs, with every deliverable, constraint, and assumption adding to the bottom line. The more time you put into fleshing out your project’s scope, the more precise your cost estimation will be. 4. Creative Design The Apple App Store alone has nearly 2 million available apps. If your product lacks visual appeal or is difficult to understand and navigate, there’s a good chance users will scroll past it. To make your product stand out, you need the support of professional UX/UI designers . The more customized your product is, the more you’ll spend to bring it to life. One alternative is to choose a standard design with pre-built templates. 5. Methodology The methodology used is closely related to research and development expenses. A traditional waterfall approach can sound cost “safe” on paper as it methodically works its way from point A to point Z. But an agile methodology can be more cost-effective in the long run because it continuously adapts as requirements change during the development process. 6. Third-Party Integration Third-party integrations like ERPs and CRMs offer multiple opportunities for businesses and users. Including them in your project can take additional time, which will affect development costs. On the other hand, these integrations can help you alter the software development cost breakdown so that instead of building unique features from scratch, you can integrate ready-made solutions into your software and cut the person-hours. How to Manage the Cost of Software Development There are so many variables that go into estimating the cost of software development, it’s nearly impossible to predict what investment your project will require. Some ways to manage costs and ensure coming in at or under budget include: Clearly defining your goals ahead of time. Using a continuous deployment solution like Agile that allows your app to be built, tested, and released much faster and more efficiently. Implementing a backlog refinement process so work can be adjusted to feedback in real-time.

      "title": "The 7 Lean Software Development Principles | Zibtek",
      "content": "Learning the 7 lean software development principles is vital to your success. The expression “lean and mean” is just another way of saying, “efficient and successful.” A lean approach to any endeavor means using only what’s necessary and determined to work effectively to compete successfully. Lean build or lean software development emphasizes optimizing efficiency and minimizing waste. Pioneered by Toyota in the lean manufacturing movement of the 1980s, the approach is now considered an integral part of the Agile software development methodology. The Guiding Principles of Lean Software Development Lean software development is a set of principles that, when applied to software development, can decrease programming effort, budgeting, and defect rates, often by up to a third. It’s an innovative approach that aims to remove all things unnecessary from software engineering. Depending on who you talk to, there are anywhere from four to seven principles of lean software development. The customer-centric approach of each aims to quicken delivery and bring higher end-user value. Waste Elimination We’ve talked before about the Pareto Principle, where 80 percent of effects come from 20 percent of causes. Back in 2002, Jim Johnson of the Standish Group applied the theory to software features, stating only 20 percent of software features are often used while the other 80 percent are infrequently, hardly ever, or never used. They may be features that, in theory, make the user experience better but, sad to say, if people aren’t using them, they’re of no value. Eliminating what won’t bring value to the end-user speeds the development process, removes unnecessary system complexity, and boosts team morale. 2. Built-in Quality Naturally, every team wants to build quality into their work. Yet unless this principle is part of a disciplined practice, the result is often waste. In lean development, quality is not only QA’s job ; it belongs to everyone. Agile tools for building in quality can include test-driven, incremental development, continuous feedback, and automation of tedious tasks. 3. Knowledge Creation Software development is a knowledge-driven progression that encourages teams to put the right structures in place for proper learning. Simple in theory, this principle requires complete focus and commitment. It’s typically implemented through training, code reviews and comments, pair programming, sharing sessions, and more. 4. Deferred Commitment Many development people instinctively make decisions as quickly as possible. As a lean principle, deferring decision-making and commitment: Encourages project teams to keep options open for a more extended period so they can gather more data and information for making crucial decisions. Results in more time to learn and gain valuable knowledge, which results in even better decisions. Ensures a project doesn’t suffer negative impacts from poor decision-making. When you think about it, it makes perfect sense. Isn’t it better to put off making rash decisions if the result is a product with fewer failures along the way? 5. Fast Delivery The purpose of Agile development is to deliver software as quickly as possible. Lean development ties into learning from failures and receiving feedback. The more quickly a team delivers features for user testing, the faster it can make the product better. Put another way, don’t be afraid to release an imperfect product that you can update based on customer response. 6. Team Respect Lean management has always focused on “people over processes.” It honors the individual and recognizes the fact that people do the real work. You can communicate respect to the team in any number of ways as long as you start with a healthy work environment that supports the lean method’s principles. Proactive communication, process improvement, and conflict resolution techniques are excellent examples of conveying team respect. 7. See the Whole Some people refer to this as total optimization. Whatever you choose to call it, it’s about seeing software development as a big-picture venture that envisions the whole scope of where a project is going, who it’s going to affect, and how it can reach the widest audience. In other words, long-term thinking trumps short-term thinking every time. Lean Software Development Principles: The Key to Successful Product Launch Because it helps reduce costs, minimize risks, and speed up results , software development outsourcing is a great way to make your project leaner. Zibtek uses lean software development principles that generate innovative solutions, lower development costs, and shorten development cycles. Based on years of experience, we know the best way to deliver a product people like is to listen to what they have to say. This human-centric mindset ensures a good digital product that not only pleases your customers but also propels your company forward. Have a custom software project you’re looking to kick off?

      "title": "Finding Software Development Services You Can Trust | Zibtek",
      "content": "Poor Charlie Brown, every time he decides to put his faith in Lucy’s assurances she’ll hold the football in place, he ends up sprawled flat on his back, disillusioned and questioning his trust in others. Why is it that we can all relate to this so well? It’s an unfortunate fact of life that everyone gets burned by someone they’ve put their trust in. And when that someone’s a professional who you’ve paid a lot of money to, you can often feel downright scorched. If you’ve previously been let down by a software development company, or your concern about being taken advantage of is holding you back from trusting one, this post’s for you. We’re going to guide you through finding a reliable partner that delivers on its assurances and prioritizes your project’s success. What Should I Research? It can be awfully tempting to hand over a software development project to someone promising the moon and hoping for the best. However, educating yourself on key software-related topics and terms helps level the communication field, ensuring you make informed decisions and find a dependable partner. How To Find Trustworthy Software Development Services Process and methodologies . Software development methodologies include Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and Waterfall, each offering distinct advantages and approaches to project management. Understanding the basics of each helps evaluate the company's development process and determine if it aligns with your requirements. Languages . Numerous programming languages exist to build different custom software and apps, including Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. Familiarizing yourself with which languages are typically used for software or apps like yours, helps you assess whether a company’s well-versed in the technologies your project requires. Software development lifecycle . A software project’s lifecycle covers everything from requirements gathering and design to development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Knowing these stages gives you more confidence in being able to track your project’s progress. Project management principles. Setting clear goals, defining project scope, establishing timelines, and managing risks should be defining standards for any software development company worthy of your business. Quality assurance and testing. One of the greatest advances in software development has been the automation of testing scripts . Knowing if a company conducts testing using the latest technologies to ensure software quality can help you find a reliable partner. Industry standards and best practices . Research for yourself, industry standards and best practices in software development so you’re better equipped to assess whether a company is up to speed on the latest trends and adheres to the industry’s ethical principles. Security and data protection: Learning about the latest cybersecurity and data protection measures helps determine a company's commitment to safeguarding sensitive information. Budgeting and costs estimation. Getting burned by a software developer often goes hand-in-hand with hiring the company that made the cheapest bid. Researching what similar successful apps and software to yours should cost can help you avoid choosing a partner based solely on the lowest cost, quality be damned. Spending some time on market research and competitive analysis is another good way to identify software development companies specializing in your niche. That said, keep in mind that experienced providers can typically deliver high-quality products and offer more comprehensive solutions that meet your goals and objectives, no matter your industry or sector. What Green Flags Might I Find? Unlike those pesky red ones we so often ignore because we want something so badly, green flags let you know a software development company is reliable, competent, and trustworthy. Rather than the typical “fake-out” delivered by the Lucy’s of the world, these will highlight the right people to hold the ball. Our favorites for identifying a promising partner include: Proven expertise and experience . This can be verified with a strong portfolio, positive reviews, and testimonials from satisfied and repeat clients. Structured project management . Does the company provide regular progress updates and milestone tracking? Zibtek uses a practical agile approach to software development that ensures efficient communication and transparency throughout the project’s lifecycle, allowing clients to stay informed and confident in the development process. Emphasis on quality assurance . Development companies that prioritize rigorous testing and quality assurance show a commitment to delivering high-quality products. Transparent pricing . No software development company worth its salt will underbid a project just to get the job. Ones that offer straightforward pricing without hidden costs or fees demonstrate professionalism and integrity, earning their customers’ trust. Post-development support . A software project doesn’t end the moment after launch. Reliable development companies stand by their work and are ready to fix any issues that arise after the project’s completion. Other signs you’re on the right track include finding a company willing to explore innovative solutions to address your unique needs. And if it has a lengthy history in the industry and a reputation for successfully delivering projects on time and budget, you’ve hit the trifecta! How To Find Trustworthy Software Development Services What Warning Signs Should I Look For? So, when should you trust your instincts and run screaming for the nearest exit, putting as much distance as possible between you and the candidate at hand? If they don’t have or won’t show you a portfolio of projects and a list of references. Numerous negative online reviews frequently mention missed deadlines, low-quality work, and unprofessional behavior. If the company is evasive, slow to respond to your questions, or talks in circles, cross them off the list. If you start to hear grandiose promises like delivering a complex project in an impossibly short time or at a significantly lower cost than others, trust us, you’re in bad company. Companies resistant to an agile methodology aren’t necessarily terrible developers, but forgoing an iterative process and structured development approach can lead to chaotic and disorganized projects with poor communication. If they want you to pay for an initial consultation or post-development support. A reliable software company always offers a complimentary strategy session and includes post-launch support as part of its bid. What Questions Should I Ask The Software Development Team? If you’ve whittled down your potential partners list to two or three choices, asking the right questions of each one can make the final decision easier. The aim is to choose a software development company that aligns with your goals and values, creating a partnership built on trust and mutual understanding.

      "title": "Why You Should Use AngularJS For Web Application Development | Zibtek",
      "content": "Imagine if every time you went to a bookstore, each book was housed in its own room. To find what you’re looking for, you need to move from one room to the next, each time entering a new space that requires you to orient yourself with the layout and adapt to unfamiliar surroundings. After exploring dozens of rooms and still not finding what you came for, you’ll likely walk out. Sadly, no one wins; you lose time you’ll never get back, and the store loses money as the inconvenient and discouraging setup fails to engage potential customers. Now picture being in a digital bookstore where every available title is nicely displayed on a single interactive table. You effortlessly scroll away, clicking on books that interest you and reading summaries and reviews without leaving the table. Everything you want or need is right there in front of you. Which experience would you choose? Single-Page and Multi-Page Applications In the world of web application architecture, single-page applications (SPAs) are contained within a single web page. Unlike traditional multi-page applications (MPAs), which load new pages each time a user takes an action, SPAs dynamically update the content on the page without requiring a full page reload. This allows for a smoother and more responsive user experience, similar to that of a desktop application. They’re suitable for various use cases, including social media platforms, real-time applications, and productivity tools. SPAs typically rely on JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as AngularJS, to handle the client-side rendering and manage application state. The framework provides tools and abstractions that simplify the web app development process and handles tasks like routing, data fetching, and component management. In the context of our bookstore analogy, an SPA is akin to having all the books neatly displayed on the single interactive table. AngularJS is the efficient shop owner who curates the book collection to ensure seamless navigation, dynamic updates, and an enhanced user experience. It does this by reducing page reloads and improving interactivity. It can also provide offline capabilities through caching mechanisms, allowing users to continue using the web app even with limited or no internet connectivity. Benefits of Using AngularJS for Web App Development What is AngularJS? Created and maintained by Google, the AngularJS framework is a comprehensive platform for building web applications. The latest version, often called \"Angular 2+\" or “Angular,\" provides a robust set of tools, libraries, and features that facilitate the development of dynamic, scalable, and high-performance web apps. Popular with brands like Amazon, PayPal, and Netflix, Angular’s main objective is to help businesses develop SPAs that leverage features like two-way data binding, component-based architecture, and powerful template syntax to deliver exceptional user experiences that drive customer satisfaction and engagement. However, SPAs can be more complex to develop than traditional MPAs, as they require a greater emphasis on client-side logic and sometimes introduce SEO-related and initial load time challenges. They also often need careful memory and resource management, as the entire application resides in a browser's memory. Outsourcing AngularJS web development or augmenting your internal team with experienced Angular engineers can be a smart approach to overcoming these complexities. The Benefits of AngularJS for Web App Development Angular brings a boatload of advantages to web app development, such as simplifying development, enhancing user experience, and promoting efficient development team collaboration. Modularity and code organization . Angular promotes a modular approach to building applications that enhances code organization, reusability, and maintainability, making it easier to develop and scale complex applications. Two-way data binding . This powerful feature establishes synchronization between the model (data) and the view (UI), allowing changes in one to automatically be reflected in the other and vice versa, simplifying the management and updating of data and reducing manual efforts and potential bugs. Dependency injection . Angular has a built-in dependency injection (DI) system that makes it easy to manage dependencies between different components and services. It also enables the creation of loosely coupled and reusable code, so it’s easier for engineers to write unit tests, enhance code maintainability, and improve application scalability. Enhanced productivity . A comprehensive set of tools, libraries, and features that streamline development and boost productivity is what makes Angular a darling of the web app development world. Its extensive ecosystem of resources simplifies common development tasks, accelerates the development process, and lets developers create high-quality web apps with efficiency and ease. Strong community support . Angular has nearly 2.5 million active users and a large community of developers worldwide who share extensive documentation, tutorials, and resources. The Google Angular team provides regular updates, bug fixes, and improvements to the framework, ensuring long-term support and stability. While Angular is a preferred choice for building robust and scalable web apps, it’s worth noting that the framework has a steeper learning curve than others. The choice of framework for your project ultimately depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the development team. Are There Times to Choose a Framework Other Than AngularJS? Yep, like any other software development project, there are times when a “popular” framework isn’t necessarily the right choice for your project. Don’t get us wrong—we’re big fans of Angular’s ability to build scalable and reliable web apps. But sometimes it just doesn’t make sense to use Angular, such as for: Short-term projects or those with limited budgets and resources. SEO-optimized apps that would probably benefit from more SEO-friendly frameworks like ReactJS , NodeJS , and Rails , as they provide efficient server-side rendering, high-performance handling of traffic, and built-in SEO-friendly features, Lightweight web apps with static content, such as landing pages. Benefits of Using AngularJS for Web App Development What Else Should I Use AngularJS For? Together with large and complex web apps, projects that can benefit from Angular include: Enterprise web apps Apps with dynamic content Progressive web apps Long-term projects Cross-platform compatibility Apps that require high-level stability Should I Outsource AngularJS Web Development or Hire Internally? That depends. Outsourcing can be beneficial when you have limited in-house expertise or resources. Hiring internally, on the other hand, gives you direct control over the development process. In the end, the best choice is the one that finds the perfect balance between cost, expertise, flexibility, and your project’s specific requirements. Sometimes, the ideal solution is a hybrid one, where you augment your internal team with external experts when needed. Why Zibtek for AngularJS Development?

      "content": "Code reusability offers a lot of convenience for developers and it also leads to cost savings for clients. What could be better than having to write the code once and being able to reuse it multiple times to build apps for any deployment target. If only there was such a technology which could make it possible for web, mobile, native mobile and native desktop apps, right? Actually, this isn’t a wish that remains unfulfilled. There are a few development technologies that enable developers to get the most out of their work and also reduce the costs involved for clients. Angular happens to be one of those tools and it's also among the most popular. It's built by a team of engineers that have a passion for making web development feel effortless. What is Angular? Angular is a popular web framework used for building apps. It's an open source TypeScript-based framework that's led by the Angular Team at Google in addition to a community of experts and corporations. It's actually a complete rewrite from the very same team that built AngularJS. There are quite a few differences between Angular and AngularJS as it's a complete rewrite of the latter from scratch. Angular isn't limited to the concept of controllers as it uses a hierarchy of components as the main architectural characteristic. It also has a different expression syntax and prioritizes modularity as much of the core functionality has been moved to modules. It comes with support for Angular Universal which runs Angular apps on servers. Angular allows for versatile development. It's a modern web platform that can be used to deliver app-like experiences in progressive web apps. It supports cross-platform development, enabling developers to create native mobile apps with strategies from Cordova, Ionic, or NativeScript . It's even possible to develop desktop-installed apps for Mac, Windows and Linux with the same Angular methods used for web apps in addition to the ability to access native operating system APIs. Speed and performance is prioritized in Angular. It turns templates into code that's optimized for JavaScript virtual machines. It's also universal as developers can serve the first view of their app on Node.js, .NET, PHP, and other servers for near-instant rendering in only HTML and CSS. Angular is often coupled in the MEAN stack for increased speed and interoperability. Through code splitting, Angular apps can load quality with the new Component Router that provides automatic code splitting so that users only load the code that's required to render the view they have requested. Advantages of the Angular framework Angular is a great app design framework and development platform for those who want to create highly efficient and sophisticated single-page apps. The speed and convenience that it provides is one of its biggest advantages. Developers can quickly create UI views with simple and powerful template syntax. They can use command line tools to start building fast and deploy instantly. Angular also provides intelligent code completion, instant errors, and other feedback that's relevant to the work being done. Developers can keep an eye on the full development story when they're working with Angular. They have access to Karma for unit tests and they can easily know if they have broken something every time they push new code. The Protractor tool allows them to run scenario tests faster and in a more stable environment. Angular's intuitive API can be used to create high-performance and complex choreographies and animation timelines as well. This is one of the main reasons why Angular has become one of the most commonly used programming languages. Many major companies are using it for their own developments, including but not limited to Netflix, PayPal, General Motors, and perhaps the most obvious of them all, Google. What does an Angular developer do? An angular developer has many different responsibilities to take care of in their role. They are required to provide a complete front end application that functions as per the client's requirement. They also have to make sure that the application meets performance benchmarks for all of the platforms that it's going to be available on. Developers also have to write and document elements of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript depending on the nature of the project that they're working on. While building the RESTful API, they also have to collaborate with back end developers and have to remain in close contact with external web services so that everything keeps operating the way it's supposed to. Angular developers require a certain level of skills that they can utilize in their projects. A deep understanding of Core JavaScript will certainly come in handy since it's basically the building block of many application frameworks. It goes without saying that the developer needs to have an extremely in-depth grasp of the Angular framework. It's important to refresh knowledge and skills as well since Angular is updated and new versions are released quite frequently. Why do you need Angular developers on your project? Angular is counted among the most powerful JavaScript frameworks and it's backed by incredible support from Google. It also has a very strong community of developers. The expertise that Angular developers can bring to your project is going to be unmatched, provided that you have hired the right people for the job. It's vital that your idea be communicated to the developers properly so that they can form a good understanding of what's required of them. They need to understand your vision for the project so that they can inform you of the potential challenges that you might face while working on the job and what might be the best way to overcome them. Your project can benefit from the excellent knowledge of web markup, HTML, and CSS that Angular developers have. They will have a firm understanding of UX concepts, the positioning of elements, and elements interaction. This level of expertise comes in handy if you're looking to create a very high quality product. Hire talented Angular developers for your custom project You now have a solid understanding of why Angular is such a popular framework and how it can be beneficial to your project. Unless you’re a major tech company, it’s unlikely that you have an in-house team of developers that work for you full time. Even if you wanted to establish such a team, it would require a lot of investment in terms of both time and resources. This could potentially push back the development time for your project. You’ll have to send the word out first that you require Angular developers, then conduct interviews to assess their skills before extending them offers and waiting to hear back from them. It’s quite the tedious process, one that can simply be circumvented by outsourcing the job to highly skilled professionals. Sure, you could try to bring in part-time freelancers, but that could end up causing you more problems than actually fixing the ones that you have right now. It’s often difficult to keep track of the work they’re doing and there can often be a mismatch between your expectations for the project and what they’re willing or even capable of doing.

      "title": "Top 8 Reasons Why You Should Use Angular | Zibtek Blog",
      "content": "In recent years, the popularity of Angular has increased in the tech world. As an open-source framework with highly advanced JavaScript support, Angular is an attractive solution for developing web applications. Angular is developed, maintained and supported by Google and has a solid code base. It is the outcome of innovative work by Google engineers, Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons. The relationship with Google and seamless support are some of the reasons why Angular is popular among developers ( Why_developers_are_choosing_Angular ) over other JavaScript frameworks. Looking at its high marketability pace in this era of technological advancement, we have listed some noteworthy reasons why you should choose Angular: 1. Perfect implementation of Model View Controller (MVC) architecture The angular framework is based on MVC ( #1_Based_on_MVC architecture (a software design pattern used to develop web applications). It makes the code easier to extend and maintain in the future. There are other web development frameworks as well that are built on MVC architecture but Angular is perhaps the most popular among all of them. How is MVC implemented in other web frameworks? First, you need to split your app into MVC components (Model, View, and Controller). Later, you are required to write code to combine these components together again. Sometimes, other frameworks require developers to write shortcuts between the components that deteriorate the quality of the software. Therefore, implementing an MVC in any other framework is a difficult and time-consuming process for developers. How is MVC implemented in Angular? It allows you to split the app into MVC components. After that, Angular will perform the rest of the work. Angular handles your application components and serves as a channel that assimilates these components into a single application again. It lets developers create specialized apps in less time than other methods. 2. Declarative UI support The Angular framework relies on HTML for creating excellent user interfaces for mobile and web applications. HTML is a declarative language that is assisted by technologies, such as scripting language (JavaScript) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is used to define the structure of the web content. Let’s take a look at what makes HTML an amazing markup language for Angular applications- HTML offers some special attributes that determine which controllers ( https://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_controllers.asp ) (they control the data of Angular applications) you should use for a particular element. These attributes also decide “what” to load instead of “how” to load. This approach has significantly simplified app development from the What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) aspect. It means you don’t need to worry about the program flows, you simply need to characterize your application needs, and Angular will take care of all the dependencies and related conditions. 3. Uses Plain Old JavaScript Objects (POJO) data models In Angular, data models are plain old JavaScript objects (POJO). POJO is an ordinary Java object ( https://www.guru99.com/java-oops-class-objects.html#2 ), introduced by Sun Microsystems. It is easy to write and understand and also increases the reusability of the program. With POJO, your code will look more intuitive and much cleaner because- You don’t need to insert complex functions and methods in your code. It uses single declarative references. It purely focuses on business logic. It has no dependencies on the framework. Using POJO in Angular will help you to develop an intuitive, light-weight and specialized app. 4. Directives that quickly enhance functionality Angular directives help you to quickly incorporate extra functionality to HTML. Some basics about Angular Directives: By adding new attributes to HTML, you can easily extend its functionalities in Angular. These attributes are called directives. Angular contains a set of built-in directives that offers functionality for your applications. You can define your own directives in Angular. Your app only needs to set attributes to elements in order to create enhanced functionality. Angular directives accomplish this by enabling us to create our own HTML elements. 5. Less coding With Angular, you don’t need to write much code while developing web-based applications. As discussed in point no. 3, Angular uses POJO model which doesn’t require additional features or complex coding. Also, in point 4, we have discussed Angular directives. Let’s discuss how Angular directives contribute to requiring less coding. How do Angular directives contribute to less coding? You can easily initiate an Angular application and application data in just one line of code. You can seamlessly bind the values of HTML elements with application data by just adding a few code snippets. You can easily bind the value of HTML controls (including text area, select, input) to application data in just a few lines of code. Directives are separate from application code; so, another team can take the task of writing the code in parallel. This, in turn, minimizes the integration issues and application development time. 6. Easy to use filters Filters in Angular are used to format data for display to the user. It is basically used to manipulate the data on the view level (the user interface). Here are the following Angular filters- currency formats a number to a currency. For eg. $52 lowercase converts a text to a lower case number formats a number to a string. orderBy sorts or arranges an array (an ordered collection of items) by an expression. filter selects a subset of items from an array.date formats date to a specified format. uppercase converts a text into upper case letters.json formats an object to a JSON ( https://www.json.org/ )string. limitTo limits a string/array to a specified number of characters. Filters are easy to add in Angular. It can be added in the expressions by using the pipe character | Suppose you want to format a text into upper case letters, let’s see how easily you can do this by adding filters: Name Upper Case: {{student.fullName() | uppercase}} More about Angular filters Filters are standalone functions that make it possible to create a sortable HTML table without even writing JavaScript code. Similar to Angular directives, Angular filters are also separated from your app. 7. Edge with modules and simplified testing With Angular, you can build the application by combining the set of separate modules ( https://angular.io/guide/architecture-modules ). These modules can be independent of one another or dependent on each other. For example, you can add a Gmail login module (as an independent module) in certain areas of your app. Angular will easily recognize these additional objects in your app and unite them together. This module separation approach in angular lets you load only necessary functions and services, making automated testing easy for the testers. 8. Parallel development and code reusability Angular allows developers to write and test the code in parallel. This parallel workflow reduces the development and testing time for applications. Another reason why Angular is emerging as an industry leader in the app world is its code reusability feature. Let’s understand what is so special about the code reusability feature: In an application, there may be a number of ‘dumb’ ( https://angular.io/guide/architecture-components ) (Dumb components act as a brick in your application wall, you can take the control over these components and place them anywhere in your application code) that can’t even determine their own internal status. In Angular, you can easily reuse these dumb components by removing unnecessary things and focus only on what you need. Let’s suppose you have developed an app and on one of the webpages, the designer wants a pop-up alert dialog box before the delete confirmation message. On the other webpage, he wants you to delete three images and add an image to another section. Thanks to the code usability feature of Angular, you don’t need to panic about these changes. You can easily reuse required components or a ‘dumb’ component (that doesn’t determine internal status, hence they won’t affect the other areas of the code) into your code.

      "title": "Angular Explained: Key Concepts & Features | Zibtek",
      "content": "Angular Explained: The Origin of Angular At Zibtek we are software development company known for highly skilled angular developers, here are some of the learnings as an angularjs development company . For many developers it's important to have Angular explained. Building great and scalable applications quickly is a key challenge. Enterprises are looking for a robust framework to simplify the development and testing process. To provide a complete enterprise solution, Google developed an open-source front-end web application framework known as Angular. With Angular, developers can build dynamic and modern web applications quickly. Here are some of the many versions of Angular: AngularJS is the first version of the Angular framework, developed in 2009. It has gained huge admiration over the years for ensuring reliable and fast apps. In 2016, Google developed a successor to AngularJS, known as Angular 2 . It was a complete rewrite of the AngularJS framework. In March 2017, Angular 4 was released. It is backward compatible with Angular 2. It came with an improved view-engine and code-generation reductions. The Angular 4.3 upgrade was released in July 2017. It featured HttpClient to provide a smaller and easier-to-use library for making HTTP requests. Angular 5 was released in November 2017. It includes support for- Progressive Web Apps (PWA)- It is an improvement to existing technology. Build optimizer- It is a command-line tool that eliminates unnecessary coding and makes the application faster. Improved Material Design- Material Design for Angular is modern UI components for web, mobile, and desktop applications. In May 2018, Angular 6 was released. It focused on a toolchain that makes it easier to migrate your applications to Angular. Angular 7.0 was released in October 2018. It focused on improving application performance. There is also visual improvements in Angular Material Design and CDK (Component Dev Kit) such as: Virtual Scrolling, Improved Accessibility of Selects, etc. Angular 7.1 mainly focused on bug fixes and router capabilities. And the current version- Angular 7.2 -released in January 2019. It improved the core framework by enhancing router capabilities and integrating Bazel (a tool used to build and test software) support. From AngularJS in 2009 to Angular 7.2 in 2020, this front-end framework has evolved rapidly. Today, Angular is used by more than 70% of software engineers for creating modern web-based applications. Angular JS Angular JS is an open-source Javascript framework that follows the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. It is used in developing Single Page Applications (SPA) projects. HTML is great if you are declaring static documents, but it gets clumsy when you are using it for declaring dynamic web applications. To address this issue, AngularJs extends HTML with additional attributes to make the applications more responsive to the users. AngularJS also speeds up your front-end development. Angular Explained: Main features of AngularJS 1. Based on MVC In this next part of Angular Explained, we talk about Angular JS. AngularJS is built on the concept of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. MVC is a software design pattern used in the development of web applications, in which: The Model maintains the data related to the application and represents the business logic. The View is a user interface that displays data to the users. It also enables users to modify the data. The Controller is a code that controls the interaction between Model and View . A URL request is raised when the user interacts with View . This request is handled by the Controller . After receiving the user’s request for applications, the Controller collaborates with the Model to prepare data needed by the View . After this, the View uses that data to display a presentable response to the users. 2. Two-way data binding This provides synchronization between the Model and the View . The View reflects the change as soon as data in the Model changes; similarly, the Model reflects the change as soon as the data in View changes. This enables the **Model **and View to be updated in real-time. With this feature of AngularJS, you can bind the data to the HTML controls by just adding a few snippets of code, eliminating the need to write lots of code. 3. Dependency Injection Dependency Injection (DI) is a feature of AngularJS that deals with how components get hold of their dependencies. With the dependency injection, you can describe (in a declarative manner) how your application is wired. Including main() method in coding sometimes becomes difficult to maintain, but with DI, your applications don’t need **main() **method. DI is a core feature of AngularJS that can replace any components that don’t fit the user’s needs. AngularJS comes up with built-in testability features. It takes full advantage of DI and eliminates test flakiness. 4. Ready to use templates AngularJS provides ready-to-use templates to ease your front-end development process. Even people with little computing skills can design top-quality applications. Angular 2 The original AngularJS JavaScript development framework was accepted widely by the developers. But it has some limitations. To deliver better performance, Google endeavored a rewrite for the second generation, resulting in Angular 2. Angular 2 is re-written in TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. In TypeScript, we can easily do a static analysis of source code. Unlike in Javascript, the code is more predictable in TypeScript. Additional features in Angular 2: In Angular 2, the code can run speedily in JavaScript virtual machines. This is because the compiler is placed between written code and output shipped to a production application. It offers a cleaner structural component model that focuses on interoperation with technologies. Difference between AngularJS and Angular 2 Angular 2 is written on TypeScript while AngularJS is written on JavaScript. AngularJS uses the concept of scope and controller. Scoping a variable enables you to add many variables that will be visible in View and Controller. But Angular 2 doesn’t have a concept of scope and controller. Unlike AngularJS, Angular 2 supports Angular Universal (a technology that uses the server to run an Angular application). Unlike AngularJS, Angular 2 has its own modern UI components, called Angular Material. Together these components work across the web, mobile, and desktop. In AngularJS, you have to remember the right ng directive to bind an event, but Angular 2 uses “()” for event binding and “[ ]” for property binding. AngularJS uses rootScope, which allows the variables to be available throughout the application. On the other hand, Angular 2 uses the concept of components and directives as its main architectural approach, where the component is a directive with a template. Current version: Updates of Angular 7.2 Angular 7.2 was released in January 2019. With Bazel support, it is helping developers and testers in the development process. It has also enhanced routing capabilities. Here are the updates of Angular 7.2: 1. Bazel support To help developers and testers in automating the development process and testing of software, the Angular team has integrated the tool Bazel into Angular.Bazel is a free software tool that you can use to build and test software quickly. How to use Bazel in your project: Install Bazel schematics by using @angular/bazel . After this, the build will be managed by Bazel. Execute the command ng new , like this- ng new bzl-app–collection=@angular/bazel 2. Enhanced Router capabilities Let’s understand the enhanced core router capabilities in technical parameters: Incorporation of Navigation type during router navigation has targeted URLs, Navigation and NavigationExtras data. Allow for passing of state to routerLink directives, as well as passing of state to NavigationExtras . When navigating the previous page, the restoration of the whole process is managed by Angular router. Introducing pathParamsOrQueryParamsChange mode for runGuardsAndResolvers which updates the UI and syncs the URL with local changes. This offers the following: Guard and resolver ignore changes to matrix parameters. Whenever there is any change in the path, guards and resolver will be rerun. If you are not familiar with Angular guards and resolver, then have a look at this: Guards in Angular: Implementing the guard types ( CanActivate , CanDeactivate and CanLoad ) is used to protect routes. It decides if a user is allowed to activate a certain route, leaving a certain route, or even asynchronously loading a route. Angular resolver: enables you to provide the datarequired for a route before the route becomes active. Why developers are choosing Angular? It is opinionated- Angular offers developers defaults for things like: language choice, state management, network connectivity, build toolchain, etc. The angular team continuously tests and validates these defaults to ensure a reliable and steady Angular platform. It is trustworthy- Being a Google product, Angular can take advantage of all the testing infrastructure offered by Google.Google validates every change made to the Angular framework. There are no possibilities of breaking changes or regressions in Angular because the framework is already being tested in hundreds of projects before its public release. It has a strong ecosystem- Angular owns numerous reusable tools, code samples, and libraries. These tools are continually updated. Companies such as VMWare, NativeScript, and Teradata have full support for Angular. The Angular ecosystem includes many tech-giants, such as Oasis Digital, Thinkster and Galvanize. Many companies such as Range, Nrwl, etc., have a majority of their businesses in Angular only. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

      "title": "How to migrate your applications to Angular | Zibtek Blog",
      "content": "What is Angular? Building apps from scratch could be a reckless move for developers in the continually changing landscape of customers’ tastes. Great coders know that good work comes from a robust framework that simplifies the development and testing process. To provide developers a platform that quickly builds web applications, Google developed an open-source web application framework known as Angular. Some key points about Angular : It facilitates front-end development. It is developed from the JavaScript framework. It empowers developers with features to build apps for any deployment target. With its declarative templates, it allows developers to build amazing apps without requiring them to do lots of coding. With the changing demands of front-end developers, the Angular team worked on perfecting their techniques. Angular provides a variety of tools to assist front-end developers in building apps. Reasons why developers hesitate to migrate Developers sometimes hesitate to make the transition from their older infrastructure. Typically, the reasons are: They have to learn an entirely new methodology, despite having spent time learning how to migrate to AngularJS. They need to renew workflows that are already well-implanted into the company’s structure. They need to rewrite code . But migrating to Angular is a long-term solution to app development that is worth the initial investment. Why Angular? Angular is one of the most powerful frameworks in the market. We have listed some of its advantages and features. It will help you to evaluate carefully before migrating to a new infrastructure. Code consistency Unlike traditional software, modern software isn’t meant to be coded in a way that requires the programmer to update the code throughout the years. The Angular framework goes well with the modern software development methodology. It ensures code consistency and offers several benefits:- Editing your existing code becomes much easier, as you don’t need to go through the entire code. Ensures simplified unit testing Improves readability of the code Enables efficient code maintenance While delayed launches or increased costs are the risks associated with inconsistent coding, consistent coding makes websites easier to use and enables the use of templates or pre-defined code snippets. Components Later versions of Angular use component-based systems, eradicating the complex methodology of AngularJS. Component-based codes are easier to read and write. Each component has a defined specification that is independent of its environment. It makes them highly reusable across the app, ensuring a smooth development process for developers. Most developers face issues in maintaining code. Angular addresses this maintainability issue, as it is written in Typescript. Typescript is derived from JavaScript and provides the following benefits: Enables developers to find bugs and errors earlier in the process. Speeds up the development process Reduces run-time errors, by recognizing mistakes before they come to light. Right approach for mobile apps AngularJS was developed with the emergence of mobile apps. Before the advent of AngularJS, mobile apps didn’t have the same level of ubiquity they have today. Lazy loading technique of Angular has introduced an idea to load modules only when they’re needed. It makes applications faster from the user’s perspective. For more agile and active performance, some of the non-essential packages are also moved from the framework’s core, hence facilitating a mobile-driven approach. How to migrate your application smoothly to angular Whether you are migrating a web app or making the transition from an old company’s designs to a new one, Angular brings you a lot of benefits for your projects. But the things you should follow while undergoing migration process are: Adopt a seamless migration Migrating a web application to Angular requires developers to rewrite the existing code. Both frameworks- AngularJS and Angular can operate in the same application together. It allows you to make the transition over time without worrying about migrating everything all at once. Tools that will help you to migrate from AngularJS to Angular:- ngMigration assistant: It is a command-line tool that recommends a migration path after analyzing an AngularJS application. It provides data regarding the complexity, volume, and pattern of an app. ngMigration forum: It is a community hub that answers all your migration questions while directing you to the migration solution. Here you can learn and share information on Angular migration. Approach TypeScript The original AngularJS was written in vanilla JavaScript, but later it was updated to TypeScript. TypeScript builds on modern JavaScript. Fundamentally, TypeScript is similar to JavaScript, but it brings you numerous advantages. In the future, to save yourself from trouble and to get efficient results, keep the following things in mind while approaching TypeScript to migrate: Go through the entire existing code block instead of just renaming your file extensions Before full migration, make some annotations in code blocks. Consider TestBed cautiously Checking for bugs and unit testing requires a large workforce. Even considering it can scare many away from migrating to a new framework. Fortunately, Angular offers an amazing testing utility, known as TestBed. It configures and initializes the environment for unit testing. Considering the size and scale of your project, keep the following things in mind: For smaller projects, TestBed can be a viable method to test codes. But, in a larger project that requires running thousands of tests, TestBed will be slow. It can be an extensive process for such projects. Stepping into the migration process can pay off in the long run. It will be a smart move for your company if you take advantage of the benefits migration offers. Don’t be afraid to make a jump to Angular, if you want to speed up your development, debugging, and security processes or partner with a proficient angularjs development company .

      "title": "Guide To Hiring a Java Development Company | Zibtek",
      "content": "Are you in search of a good Java development outsourcing company but don’t know where to start? We understand. There are so many Java app development “experts” on the market that the idea of choosing one can make your head spin. And that’s a shame, because second-guessing yourself and feeling indecisive right from the start is no way to begin the software development process. So, let’s dial things back for a minute and try to get everyone in a lighter frame of mind over all things Java. For instance, did you know that Java was invented by accident? Yep, one of the most popular programming languages ever came into being when Canadian computer scientist and Sun Microsystems VP James Gosling and his team were cleaning up C++ and realized they had created a new way for developers to “write once, run anywhere.” Other fun Java facts include: · Gosling originally called the language “Oak” after a tree outside his office. · The switch to Java happened when the creators realized all their best ideas were being hatched at a local coffee shop. · The language’s famous waving mascot, Duke, was the brainchild of one of the team’s graphic artists, Joe Palrang, who went on to work as an animator on films like Shrek. In 2019, the mascot’s new personality, “Cloud Surfer Duke” was introduced. Today, Java is downloaded about a billion times a year, and there are over 9 million Java developers globally—that’s more people than live in New York City! And while Python recently topped Java as the world’s most popular programming language, there are plenty of good reasons to choose Java for your application. Hiring a Java Development Company: A Step-by-Step Guide What is Java? Java is sometimes called the “old fast grandpa” of programming languages. That’s actually a compliment, because it means its years of existence have allowed it to create libraries for nearly any task. You can find it in operating systems on your smartphone and watch, and it can even be hidden inside your desktop. From hit games to integrated development environments, it’s prized for making back-end development faster and smoother. The past 27 years have seen 20 versions of Java released, and four platforms make up the language: Java Platform, Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME. Reasons for its ongoing popularity include: 1. It’s one of the best ways to build intelligent devices (Internet of Things). 2. It’s the language of choice for Android mobile development. 3. It’s one of the leading technologies for backend tasks like exchanging data and keeping software operations disruption-free. 4. It’s cross-platform development ready. That isn’t to say that Java can’t be used for front-end development, too. It’s just that it excels at ensuring server-side needs work efficiently with no errors. Who Uses Java? You’ll find Java environments on all sorts of devices big and small. It gives Java developers a lot of flexibility for treating code as agnostic to the system on which it runs. Combine that platform independence with high-level security features and simplicity of use, and it’s easy to see why companies like Netflix, Spotify, and NASA choose the versatile language for business software and consumer apps alike. Finance Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase all rely on Java to create convenient banking apps and automate financial processes. So, too, do the New York and London Stock Exchanges. It’s a great tool for simplifying a customer’s online bill paying and offers a secure way to use their digital wallets in-store. Healthcare Java is widely used in healthcare for diagnostic systems, record-keeping, and various server and web applications. If you’re designing a mobile app for your business or facility, using Java ensures native performance reliability. Manufacturing Industrial users choose Java to unlock the power of automation and make their businesses more profitable and successful. In today’s environment, a manufacturer’s growth is directly tied to its ability to integrate its many systems, including machinery, equipment, and other processes. Java excels at helping businesses process and control systems in an integrated way so they can achieve their business objectives, even when they evolve or change. Education Because Java is a universal general-purpose programming language, it can be used to develop desktop and mobile apps, embedded systems, and more that work no matter which device is used. Systems like Canvas, Blackboard, and Moodle are just a few examples of software that makes it easier for students to learn remotely, in the classroom, or in a hybrid environment. Other industries that rely on Java include aerospace and defense, entertainment, government, energy, and automotive. But don’t walk away from these examples thinking Java is only suitable for large enterprises. There are plenty of advantages to applying it to small business projects as well. For instance, it can quickly accommodate many users as your digital efforts expand. And it offers nearly limitless possibilities for finding the perfect Java development company for your specific needs.

      "title": "Software Deployment Process: Everything You Need to Know",
      "content": "The software deployment process is one of the most crucial parts of any development project. The job isn’t done when the development work on your software is completed. Unless it’s properly deployed, the software isn’t going to be able to fulfill its intended purpose. That’s why software deployment is such an important part of the entire process. The software deployment process This isn’t just limited to the first installation of software. Any and all subsequent updates also have to go through the deployment process, otherwise, how can they be sent out to the users that are waiting for them? What is software deployment? The different methods and processes utilized to make a system software available to the users can be collectively referred to as software deployment. However, it can mean some else entirely in the case of web development. An update to your favorite website isn't sent out directly to visitors. The developers merely deploy their changes to a server which makes the update instantly accessible for any and all visitors to the website. At its core, though, software deployment is simply the delivery of completed software to the customer who ordered it or to the consumers that are already using it. It's one of the final stages of the development process since a software shouldn't be deployed until it has been thoroughly tested. This is done to ensure that there are no flaws or bugs in the code and if some are discovered during the testing phase, they're fixed before the software is deployed. Building a software deployment process A well thought out software deployment process is important for everything to go without a hitch. Organizations should develop their own processes as they can be based on their unique business requirements or simply on industry best practices, as the case may be. There are three primary phases in the deployment process. 1. Preparation Start things off by collecting the code that needs to be deployed. This is an important part of the process since this ensures that only the correct code is going to be deployed. It's at this stage that the code which needs to be deployed along with configuration files, libraries or resources can be packaged as one resource. To do this, check completed user stories in the project management software or simply the original message that necessitated the start of deployment. 2. Testing No new software should be deployed unless it has been properly tested. This is done so that no flaws or bugs are found later on. The software first needs to be deployed to a staging environment where all of the required tests can be run through a pre-configured set of tests. Developers then have to review the results and fix any bugs that may have been found. 3. Deployment It’s only after these crucial stages have been crossed that the software can go live. This is the time when the new code is merged into the production environment . This process is done exactly as it is with the test environment so there should be little to no chance of running into any problems at this stage. As a best practice, check for bugs on the live server just to be safe. 5 software deployment tools that can kickstart your platform The actual deployment stage can be performed through dedicated tools that aim to streamline the process. These tools try to make the method of distributing the software and any subsequent updates very simple. There's no shortage of deployment tools and most of them support different platforms and infrastructures. AWS CodeDeploy Amazon has its own software deployment tool called CodeDeploy and its best suited to those who are using Amazon Web Services. The tool can be used to automate deployments to Amazon EC2 instances but that's not all it can do. CodeDeploy can also be used for on-premise software deployments as well. When the process has been set up, CodeDeploy allows developers to quickly deploy changes, enabling them to take full advantage of the incredible scalability of AWS. Amazon doesn't charge anything for CodeDeploy but payment is required for the AWS cloud computing resources utilized to deploy software. Bamboo Bamboo comes from Atlassian, the highly regarded software company behind Jira. The benefit here is that it integrates seamlessly with other Atlassian products. Bamboo offers continuous integration and deployment. It can be used to automate many different tasks like bug detecting and software testing. Bamboo also allows developers to deploy their apps to app stores automatically, it can be used with any programming language, and it maintains release history archives, making it easier for developers to go back and check something should the need arise. Pricing for Bamboo starts as low as $10. Jenkins Jenkins was actually one of the very first automated software deployment tools which is why it continues to be among the most popular. Since it's open source, there's an active community behind it as well with many different plugins available to extend its functionality. This tool allows for the automation of many different tasks like code analysis, bug detection, and software testing. It's capable of working collaboratively with multiple machines as well. Octopus Deploy This is an automated release management tool aimed at modern developers and DevOps teams. Octopus Deploy is compatible with many scripting languages like Ruby and bash, it works with Java, ASP.Net, Windows services and more with support for different database types. It's useful for automating deployments in the cloud and on-promises. Octopus Deploy is offered for free to some commercial users and small teams. A Pro subscription starts at $700 but can go up exponentially if used as a full-fledged deployment tool that allows support and upgrades as well. GitLab CI This continuous integration tool is built into GitLab, a popular Git repo hosting platform that also provides relevant tools. GitLab CI got its start as a standalone project but was later moved into the core and consequently, it can only be used with GitLab now. Like GitLab, this tool is also open source and free for the community version. As you'd expect, it works very well with the GitLab workflow, can be used with GitLab command-line runners, allows you to run your builds on basically anything that supports Go with scripts that work with any programming language. What about open-source software deployment? Open source software has now become commonplace in the industry, whether that's Linux being used in data centers or Drupal being used to create amazing websites. Even companies like Microsoft and Oracle who were previously strongly opposed to open source software have now evolved to embrace it as its popularity has grown significantly. The challenge with open source software deployment is that these projects are driven by the communities behind them. This means one open source app can have different forms but open source software itself is divided into three primary variants. Forks have their own development branch and often their own development community. Distributions are a collection of different pieces of software that combine to create the whole product. Vendor distributions are essentially enhanced distributions of open source software sold by vendors like Red Hat, Cloudera, Microsoft and Google. The features of open source software are set by the community. This means new releases don't follow a predictable schedule. Furthermore, these new features might not fulfill the needs of some groups of users. It's also possible that features that developers create may not make it to the main branch of the software simply because the community decided that they're not important. Organizations that deploy open source software in a production environment have to take these differences into account. We can help you deploy your software quickly and effectively One of the most effective ways to go about your software deployment is to work with experts in the field.

Software deployment is the process of delivering and installing software updates and applications to devices. It involves preparing the software for installation, installing it on the target devices, and then configuring it to meet the needs of the users. What are some common challenges in software deployment? Some common challenges in software deployment include ensuring compatibility with the target system, handling dependencies and conflicts between different software components, and managing configuration changes. Another challenge is ensuring that the deployment process is reliable and repeatable, so that the software can be easily updated or rolled back if necessary. What are some best practices for software deployment? Some best practices for software deployment include automating as much of the process as possible, testing the software thoroughly before deploying it, and having a clear rollback plan in case of any issues. It is also important to communicate with end users and stakeholders during the deployment process to keep them informed of any changes or issues that may arise. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

      "content": "Adobe Major software company develops new breed of customer experience application. Background Building And Integrating LiveFyre Into The Adobe Experience Manager Adobe Experience Manager gives marketers the tools they need to easily weave on-brand user-generated content into their websites and other marketing experiences. Livefyre’s intuitive technology gives brands and publishers the ability to add social content to their branded websites, social media sites, and helps drive audience exploration of products and services in a uniform way. Brand cohesion in turn drives traffic, conversions and revenue. Adobe chose Zibtek as its custom software development company to build and integrate Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). Principal engineering spanned a course five-years, covering front end development, backend development and quality assurance and testing. Adobe acquired Livefyre in 2016 and again chose to lean on Zibtek’s custom software development services to integrate the product into the Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Marketing Cloud. CONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY Our Strategy How we work Create Our designers work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow Sprint Daily status updates and receive product builds every two-week's as we add features Learn We analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features Problems Building the initial solution: Adobe required a proof of concept to be developed followed by a minimum viable product. App Components: The platform needed to have the capability to take in and redeploy a wide variety of data sets. Image files, PDFs, gifs, vector files and dozens of inputs needed to be loaded, then redeployed into corresponding locations. These assets had to flawlessly display the corresponding media with other relevant metadata. AEM Asset Integration: Integration spanned both Adobe’s internal systems as well as third party connections. The product needed to quickly embrace any upgrades that came down the Adobe Cloud pipeline and accommodate rapid feature development especially when it comes to different versions of AEM. Solution After an initial development phase was completed, we broke into full scrum and began to execute on the LiveFyre team’s vision for a unified branding suite for businesses of all sizes. We built the app components using Mustache and Less.JS, which runs on NodeJS. Additionally, the software used Mocha and Jasmine, which runs on the Karma test runner, to automate test code coverage. Integrations built by Zibtek’s software development services team permitted users to select user-generated content (UGC) from internal libraries and share them with external media sources. Besides using the UGC library, users gained the ability to fetch relevant assets using various filters from social networking sites like Twitter and Instagram. After collecting the assets, users were then able to insert retrieved assets into various app components as required or push them uniformly across all digital channels. To build the AEM Asset Integration UI, we used Coral, Granite, and JavaScript extensively. Testing automation was built and automated using Nightwatch JS, a Selenium instance. To facilitate redundancy, we used numerous development kits to build each unique component. As a largely standalone product, the core functionalities specific to the app are handled or managed within a monolithic codebase. Previous Next Result The Adobe Livefyre project was a major success for the Adobe brand and now serves a major role in the content landscape for brands around the globe. Zibtek’s custom software development services team helped define a new breed of digital experiences by enabling brands to integrate real-time social and unified brand experiences into their content strategy. 4+ Countries 500+ Happy Clients 1000+ Projects 200+ Domain Experts Ready to start your project?

CONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY Our Strategy How we work Create Our designers and architects work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow. Sprint Receive product builds every two-week's as we add features. Learn We analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features. Problems The client identified a gap in the market for product teams that wanted to automatically aggregate customer feedback. The non-technical founder needed a custom software development firm to bring their idea to life. The goal was to create a minimum viable product that could be salable at launch and also be used on itself. The business model chosen was SaaS software development; the client wanted an immediately marketable product. Initial market feedback suggested that building a SaaS product was a natural fit because the product had to be adaptable to varying team and customer base sizes and still analyze the feedback given by clients or team members in a dynamic and familiar way for small teams. The tool, as it was conceived, had a built-in feedback loop – when firms used it, data drove the product development roadmap. The platform required direct API integration with Jira, Slack and customer relationship management systems like SalesForce and a wide range of third-party platforms. Solution We guided the company through a preliminary discovery phase that included wireframing, design and architecture. As a result of preliminary planning, determinations were made to scale back components of the initial scope to focus on the core aspects of what the business truly needed to launch. We helped Wantoo design and develop the novel concept of ‘Idea Boards’ that help firms get feedback whenever customers interact with a product and company. Every physical data point in the customer journey, digital, or mobile became collectable with just a single line of code. Integrated with Zendesk, Salesforce, Twitter, and Facebook APIs among other social platforms, the tool could be implemented by enterprise firms from day one.

Background Advanced Healthcare Data Suite Statix engaged Zibtek to provide custom healthcare software development services and built an online application that facilitates multi-center studies that: Define question sets and online surveys in order to collect information from patients Provide coordinated data collection for multi-center research projects Provide HIPAA compliant data storage for healthcare information Provide efficient data delivery (including real-time raw data, real-time performance metrics and more) CONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY Our Strategy How we work Create Our architects and designers work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow Sprint Receive product builds every two-week's as we add features Learn We analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features Problems The client had built a version one application on top of a WordPress environment. Scalability, speed and other performance problems began to suffer as the system gained greater adoption. Statix needed a custom software development to take the original vision and functionality of the core application built in WordPress and convert it to a scalable application that could handle significantly more usage volume. As the software houses sensitive patient data, the client needed healthcare and software development services, largely focused on HIPAA compliance. The client wanted to allow the solution to be scalable and accommodate the growth of the business. Additional functionality was also added to further enhance security, compliance and the delivery of patient data. They also wanted to enhance the functionalities of the custom web application to streamline their business processes, delivering high-className performance to their customers. Problems with the application: In application, around 40% of the functionalities were done manually by the client, including: Manually updated attempt logs: Site coordinators (people who manage the surveys being conducted) had to manually update records in the database about the attempted calls made to study participants. For instance, if site coordinators or interviewers call a patient to take feedback or ask certain questions for surveys, and the patient didn’t answer the call or his/her phone number was incorrect, then the site coordinators had to enter these records (‘call not answered’ or ‘wrong number’) manually in the database. Manually scheduled surveys for patients: Site coordinators had to manually schedule or prioritize the surveys (consisting of a set of questions) for their patients for a certain date or time. No proper randomization for clinical trials: There was no proper randomization process on the website. Site coordinators wanted a reliable method to eliminate all the sources of bias in the treatment assignments, ensuring equality among the patients in terms of receiving treatments and data recorded. The backend functionalities of the web application were written in PHP and largely outdated. To compound the problem, the website used WordPress as its Content Management System (CMS), which caused various issues for the client such as improper data handling, problems with refreshing pages, data storage issues, etc. In order to enhance and improve their web application, they wanted to migrate from the old technologies-- PHP and WordPress to some of the latest technologies available.In order to enhance and improve their web application, they wanted to migrate from the old technologies-- PHP and WordPress to some of the latest technologies available. The website did not have a proper authentication process. The client needed to keep their network secure by only permitting verified users to access protected resources. The client needed a Business Intelligence (BI) tool on the website in order to see the business progress and survey responses of the patients in the form of charts. They also needed a BI tool that was within their budget. Solution This project was resolved by domain-specific experts and engineers. Our specialists were able to deliver high-quality service that exactly met the unique business needs to build the custom healthcare application. The solutions we provided to address the problems: We automated all the work that was previously done manually in the application. Some primary issues resolved included: Automated updating of attempt logs in the database using Angular: Using Bootstrap and Angular, we automated the task of updating attempt logs in the database. We created a list, ‘Attempt type’ on the website that contained various options (including ‘No answer’, ‘Email sent’, ‘Phone busy’, and more). Unlike before, site coordinators no longer need to enter the patient's ‘attempt logs’ record manually in the database. Users simply needed to pick any option from the ‘attempt type’ list, and the record will automatically get updated in the database. Automated scheduling of surveys using Angular: Using Angular, we automated the scheduling of surveys on the website. We provided a list of options, from which the site coordinators or interviewers from the client side can select any date or time they want to take surveys. The surveys will automatically trigger on the web application at the selected time and date. Provided a proper randomization process using MEAN stack (Full-stack JavaScript, including MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js): Using MEAN stack, we provided a proper randomization process (the most reliable method for clinical trials) available on web application. The structure doesn’t allow hospitals or doctors to manipulate the results; removes bias, providing a real representation to the patients regarding the treatment or drugs used. Using MEAN stack, we improved and enhanced all the backend functionalities of the software application that were outdated. We reduced load time for all web pages and resolved all the issues related to data storage and data handling. Also, we modernized the interfaces for the entire front-end leveraging modularized loading capabilities. Using the Twilio REST API, our developers coded the app to provide a two-factor authentication (2FA) process and resolve security concerns. We embedded a Business Intelligence (BI) tool--MongoDB Charts. This reporting tool represents data in the form of dynamically created charts. With MongoDB Charts, the client was able to derive key insights, such as how a given study is progressing, how the users are responding to the application, and how the survey responses from patients were progressing, etc. After significant research, our experts presented Microsoft Power BI and MongoDB Charts as a budget-friendly option. Developers used a cloud service-- MongoDB Atlas Node.js APIs were connected to MongoDB Atlas from the application They also added additional security features, including: Admins, super admin on the client, were created and authorized to access the database or dashboard of the website in order to create charts programmatically. Admin and super admins on the client site can grant access to the database and grant view permissions to end users.. Previous Next Result Reliance on the heavily modified wordpress CMS was ended with the launch of the new, custom software application. Following the successful web application launch, the client has begun further development of a mobile application project in order to further enhance the product offering. Business outcomes that we delivered for this project: Application data retrieval and loading times were reduced by 90%, improving the overall application performance. The application became scalable with increased hardware availability. 40% increased in automation, as manual work has been eliminated. With the introduction of new technology and services, we delivered an error-free and superior quality application to our client using a cost-effective approach. Using modern technologies, our developers added additional functionality above the previous web application, enabling it to meet the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) policy standards. 4+ Countries 500+ Happy Clients 1000+ Projects 200+ Domain Experts Ready to start your project?

      "content": "Dental Warranty How we increased stability for dental insurance app that increased customer engagement Background Industry Leading Dental Insurance Dental Warranty Inc is the premier third party protection plan for patients receiving dental procedures. When a patient is receiving expensive cosmetic or dental work it is a real possibility that life events or accidents after the fact could lead to expensive rework. Patients at dental practices who use Dental Warranty gain the ability to ensure their investment is protected. Dental practices benefit from incremental revenue and patients save money; both parties reduce risk. When a dental patient receives cosmetic, restorative, fixed or removable dental treatment, many of these dental treatments are not covered under a patient’s insurance policy. In some cases it could be prohibitively expensive for a patient to pay the huge dental bills for any rework. As a result of using the service, treatments are backed by a world-className warranty policy and transferable to other dentists using the service. The outcome is peace-of-mind and savings for dentists as well as patients.

To maintain productivity and growth for the firm, the company needed to evaluate structural issues with the codebase. Over the years, the application architecture had been modified several times and included older versions of available technologies. To maintain productivity and growth for the firm, the company needed to evaluate structural issues with the codebase. The application was also lagging behind in needed updates and enhancements which would materially facilitate long term objectives in the business model. It needed improvements in front-end and back-end functionalities. The client was facing issues maintaining the database for their customers’ warranty and insurance accounts. And, in some instances page loading time on the web application was significant, leading to slow performance. A robust account set up was needed on the web application in order to display the proper information to the customers who signed up for the product. Finally, as numerous practices were using the software, ongoing support requests had to be accomplished in addition to other tasks. The application was not properly optimized to resolve routine support issues and unique customer concerns often required direct database level updates. Solution As the system used an older version of Angular, our team had to focus on cleaning up components which could be resolved with a degree of finality. Angular components which could be updated were improved and enhanced ensuring data was being properly saved in the back-end. Numerous functions were re-written along with enhancements to the user interface for the web application. Particular issues resolved in the Angular front end include: Created uniform dialogue popups – we made a dynamic className structure to ensure that the correct pop-ups messages were getting properly displayed for every customer (dental office) who accessed the website to register coverage for their patients. Eliminate data redundancy issues – in our audit, our developers discovered that the app was coded in a way that made use of numerous redundant classNamees. Significant measures were taken to eliminate problematic, redundant data issues between the .Net and Angular application layers. Speed and performance optimization - we were able to improve web application performance and optimize numerous queries for speed. Proper segregation of data reduced page loading time and improved available bandwidth on the server, making the app run significantly faster for end users. Using proper REST API structures, we fixed the following back-end issues on the web application: We corrected the pending registration list to properly display data, whereas before, even if the number of registrations exceeds the previous maximum, it would display. Account set up issues were resolved to allow the display of the relevant information, including a list of warranties, coverage, and insurance, when customers or users signed up on the product. Previous Next Result Through dedication to the project, we delivered the following business outcomes: Task turnaround time improved by 70% over previously observed periods. Refactored API code storage and the entire deployment processes, reduced deployments from several hours to under an hour.

      "content": "Fortify Mental health app becomes streamlined, speed increases, and customer satisfaction improves by 50% Background Science-Based Addiction Recovery Web And Mobile Application Fortify is a science-based recovery application that is designed to help individuals struggling with pornography addiction work to recover and have accountability. The platform includes multiple solutions built on top of the same core codebase. The impact collective structure includes Lift - a tool for combating anxiety and depression and Turn, focused on overcoming chemical dependence. The broader ‘Recovery Suite’ for healthcare professionals allows providers and patients to track outcomes through a set of unified HIPAA compliant tools. These powerful education, and community tools empower Fortify users to quit pornography, substance abuse, and overcome depression to move towards a happier and healthier lives. CONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY Our Strategy How we work Create Our architects and designers work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow Sprint Receive product builds every two-week's as we add features Learn We analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features Problems The client approached Zibtek to provide custom software development services to transform its legacy software with a focus on improving the overall flexibility, robustness, and performance of the application. With increased user volume, the firm also needed staff augmentation services to support growing support and QA needs. The firm wanted to update all four web application views, Fortify, Turn, Lift and RecoverySuite. With business growth, their solutions were becoming more complex and the growing codebase required more hands to maintain. They also needed legacy code to be refactored and made into a scalable solution that would serve the growing business needs of their clients. Problems faced by the client: The custom web application required material refactoring of core components. Numerous legacy code conflicts were causing the hardware to peg the server resulting in frequent database freezes. Apart from improvements to server side rendering performance, the application required numerous updates and additions to existing functionality to meet their unique business needs. Enterprise clients wanted enhancements to core survey sections and to implement new features and functionality to enable broader reach to a wide variety of audiences. Average page loading time within the web application was 40 seconds on an ideal network connection. Materially reducing load time, softened jarring for the user, meant that the delivery of data to the front end had to be updated asynchronously. The obvious result of better load time would be delivery of a better user experience to their customers. Solution Our team executed a comprehensive code audit in parallel with the current development team. The objective was twofold – we wanted to evaluate the defects within the system and the inefficiencies in the software development process. The desired outcome was to materially enhance the performance of Fortify, Turn, Lift and Recovery Suite, improve the consumer experience and allow the application to truly scale. Of note, the interest of enterprise clients also required additional security and testing measures to be put in place to enhance data integrity. Critical paths executed for improvement and enhancement of the applications: Operating within the existing Ruby on Rails and SQL environments, our developers worked to eradicate all issues causing hardware lockups and database freezing. This resolved immediate issues. New features and functionalities were added in the survey section of the web app. These enhancements and modifications simplified the process of conducting online surveys while increasing the user interactivity in the application, increasing on-page engagement. Solutions had to be provided without disrupting active users in any material way. Our developers navigated these issues by deploying at low system utilization times and in the evenings. Front-end enhancements led to the improvement of APIs as they often presented low hanging fruit opportunities for code repair. Previous Next Result Zibtek’s custom software development services team was able to deliver material enhancements to the client in relatively short order. Improvements applied to all four web applications: Fortify, Turn, Lift and Recovery Suite and extended to their mobile applications as well. Operating to resolve critical path items resulted in the following business outcomes: Average page loading times reduced from 40 seconds to 3 seconds. Streamlined and enhanced database functionality improving service effectiveness and reducing downtime. An almost 80% reduction in effort required to troubleshoot bugs from taking real-time feedback and conducting surveys, improving the overall business value. Customer satisfaction is enhanced by 50%. Increased application use, growing to over 155 countries Following the client’s complete satisfaction with our work, they outsourced the creation of a mobile application to us in order to develop a new mobile application from scratch. 4+ Countries 500+ Happy Clients 1000+ Projects 200+ Domain Experts Ready to start your project?

Background Compete In Virtual Fitness Challenges Training Amigo is a custom web and mobile application that helps growing firms facilitate health and wellness programs digitally. Training Amigo engaged Zibtek as their software development company of choice to build their MVP platform and support it long term with staff augmentation services. For the initial MVP development of the product, the company wanted to build a solution to facilitate virtual fitness challenges across the globe. Users also needed the option to redeem the points that they earn to get discounts and prizes. With a layer of gamification they wanted to allow users to earn wellness points by syncing their fitness devices with Health Kit. Surpassing milestones allowed users to unlock new discounts and prizes. Social features in Training Amigo let users motivate other ‘amigos’ across the globe. One of the unique features of the app is the ability to locate local health professionals and coaches across the globe. CONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY Our Strategy How we work Create Our designers work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow Sprint Receive product builds every two-week's as we add features Learn We analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features Problems The client was a non-technical founder who needed a custom software development team to bring his vision for a digital wellness platform to life. As the company was a self-funded startup, the founder needed an engineering team to guide application development towards core platform development and a functional MVP before any ancillary features were completed. The goal was to raise capital once value could be proven. Zibtek helped develop the initial product roadmap before jumping into development. One primary objective of the application was to collect data on a user’s daily activity including but not limited to steps, distance, and calories. The client wanted us to pull in the activities data from third-party devices such as iOS Health Kit and provide actionable insights using that data. This required significant custom IOT and wearable custom development. Data from various devices needed to be transformed into a unified format and required cross compatibility of data from different devices such as Fitbit, Jawbone, Health App, Withings, Apple Watch, and more. Solutions Zibtek helped the client define scope for the MVP version of the product as well as the product roadmap. Zibtek’s engineers built a simple cloud based web application that rounded out the core MVP features desired by the client and their target market. Engineers then build a single data collection module to integrate directly with various third-party applications such as Fitbit, Jawbone and Withings using oAuth. We also integrated Apple Health Kit APIs to fetch data from iOS health apps. In some cases, devices pushed data to central servers used by those external firms and was then retrieved via API. The features of the final version of the product include health screenings, preventive health care education, engagement features like connecting with other users and participating in wellness contests. Previous Next Result As a startup firm, the company needed their proof of concept to wow investors and showcase real results from the MVP. Based on our work, Training Amigo successfully completed four rounds of funding. As a result of development efforts and the capital raise, the firm has been able to flourish as an independent firm. The company continues to grow organically and maintain continued use from its customers across the US. 4+ Countries 500+ Happy Clients 1000+ Projects 200+ Domain Experts Ready to start your project?

Within the web application, Testing Mom already had online games in place, but they were interested in venturing into the mobile app space (iOS). With increased mobile device use, the company needed to become multiplatform. Specifically the firm wanted to explore mobile games and had an idea of how they wanted the game to look. Focused on education, the firm did not have an in-house developer or designer who could assist them in bringing their idea to reality. The company needed a custom and mobile application development company to build a native mobile solution. An additional objective of the game was a kid-friendly user experience and interface that would appeal to kids, while still remaining educational. The client was also on a tight timeframe with the start of the new school year. Solution Zibtek was engaged to provide custom iOS development services as well as custom android development services. Design and user interfaces were first created and approved for the mobile device format. While a hybrid application was stipulated, small proof of concept efforts were undertaken to confirm performance. Ultimately, we didn’t opt for a hybrid solution as performance and fluid movement from screen to screen was a high priority for the client. The performance derived from native applications for game development outperformed what was available from other solutions. To facilitate the highest performance and quality, two native platform apps were written using Swift for iOS and the latest long term release of the Java mobile SDK. Preview builds were generated and shared among a small group of beta testers within the organization. Prior to launching into the mobile market, the company wanted to confirm that the assessments put forward in the mobile application format conformed to the quality standards that matched the other online formats they provided. Previous Next Result The platform was able to extend its offering for children’s education into the mobile arena in the form of games and quizzes for native devices. Zibtek launched the web and mobile applications into the respective App and Play stores. Testing Mom has emerged as one of the dominant players in online education space for kindergarten students. 4+ Countries 500+ Happy Clients 1000+ Projects 200+ Domain Experts Ready to start your project?

The Giving Keys needed to hire a web development company to help take their idea from a vision to a fully-fledged working e-commerce website. The company wanted to pursue an e-commerce distribution and sales model to support its business model. But, as founders were non-technical they required the assistance of an e-commerce development firm to build their online store. As marketing efforts had a national reach, the best mechanism for supporting the business model was an intuitive shopping interface that could also be maintained by internal staff after it was established. As a young firm they needed a custom e-commerce development team to assist them in selecting an appropriate platform for the development of their store among the widely used tools including: Big Commerce development was evaluated against other platforms and included a proof of concept text to understand the ease of use for the company once setup Magento development was considered as a an open-source alternative to the paid platforms. While the platform presented a number of advantages, the complexity of maintenance and support did not serve the best interests of the company at that time. Wordpress Custom Commerce development was considered but because of platform limitations and performance implications relative to other available options and the befits of those platforms we kept looking. Shopify - was ultimately chosen as the platform for development. Custom shopify development appeared at the time to be the best choice for the firm when compared to other available options. Objectives: Easily maintainable – long term support needed to be facilitated inhouse and maintenance costs needed to be low.

As a result, the core engine which underpinned the business model was preventing the business from scaling. Much of the processes for running the collection and disbursement of funds needed to be properly calculated and then automatically moved via the backend of the application. Code was not commented, and APIs were not documented properly. There was no unit test coverage in place for the code that was written and the deployment process was manual. No pre-production environment was established and code was being deployed directly to production from the engineers' local machines.

The concept started as a one-line idea, and Zibtek was tasked with creating a market-ready product. The client needed a team to provide end to end design, development, and support engineering solutions. Pre-selling of the service led to considerable market interest. The web application needed to accommodate thousands of concurrent users making server and application scalability a top priority. Data storage integrity and considerable cloud data storage capacity was also an important part of the tool. Users need to upload and share large data files across the globe with different teams. The site needed to have high performance data storage options to allow users to upload critical information from anywhere. Solution Zibtek was retained as Planhub’s custom software developer to provide engineering services for the development of the concept. As the application needed to be developed from the ground up, we set out to make the structure as flexible as possible. The front end was built decoupled from the backend or business logic. API’s were structured in a way to be consumable by outside parties if needed. We used Angular 2+ as the frontend and PHP5 with Laravel 5.3+ as server-side technology. Since the design of this application required the product to be cloud-enabled, we used Amazon AWS for storage and hosting .We also used cloud infrastructures like AWS RDS for database storage and AWS S3 for file storage as it presented the best of available options at the time. We evaluated and selected a reputable content delivery network (CDN) provider to ensure high resource availability wherever users logged in. Previous Next Result Launch of the new Planhub platform was met with tremendous success. The client launched the platform ahead of schedule and was able to rapidly add thousands of clients.
