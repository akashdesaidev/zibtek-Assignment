# Test Chatbot Fixes

## âœ… Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Greeting Handling**

- Added special handling for greetings like "hi", "hello", "hey"
- Greetings now get a friendly welcome message

### 2. **Lower Similarity Threshold**

- Primary threshold: 0.7 (from config)
- Fallback threshold: 0.5 (for better results)
- Now handles more diverse questions

### 3. **No More Unnecessary New Chats**

- On page refresh, loads the most recent conversation
- Only creates new chat if no conversations exist
- "New Chat" button still works as expected

### 4. **Auto Conversation Titles**

- First message becomes the conversation title
- Truncated to 50 characters for display

   ```

## ðŸ“Š What Changed:

### Backend (`backend/app/services/langchain_rag.py`):

- Added `is_greeting()` method
- Added special greeting handling
- Added fallback to lower threshold (0.5) when primary (0.7) doesn't find results

### Backend (`backend/app/api/routes/conversations.py`):

- Fixed title update endpoint to accept JSON body
- Added `TitleUpdate` Pydantic model

### Frontend (`frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`):

- Changed `useEffect` to load existing conversations instead of always creating new

- Only creates new chat if no conversations exist

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting:

**If greetings still don't work:**

- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify backend restarted with new code

**If questions still rejected:**

- Check if data was ingested: http://localhost:6333/dashboard
- Verify collection "zibtek_docs" exists with documents
- Check `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` in `.env` (should be 0.7 or lower)

**If new chats created on refresh:**

- Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors
