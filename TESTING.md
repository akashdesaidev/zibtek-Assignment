    "limit": 5
  }'
```

**Expected**: Returns similar documents

## Test Results Template

Use this template to document your test results:

```
Test Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Tester: [Name]

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 | Health Check | ✅ PASS | |
| 1.2 | API Documentation | ✅ PASS | |
| 2.1 | Chat Interface Load | ✅ PASS | |
| 3.1 | Valid Zibtek Questions | ✅ PASS | |
| 4.1 | Direct Role Manipulation | ✅ PASS | |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Bot always rejects questions

**Solution**: Check if data ingestion completed. View Qdrant dashboard to verify documents exist.

### Issue: Slow responses

**Solution**:

- Check OpenAI API status
- Verify network connection
- Check backend logs for errors

### Issue: Frontend can't connect to backend

**Solution**:

- Verify CORS settings in backend .env
- Check if backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

## Automated Testing (Future Enhancement)

Consider adding:

- Unit tests for backend services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for frontend with Playwright/Cypress
- Load testing with Locust or k6

---

## Success Criteria

The system is considered fully functional when:

✅ All health checks pass  
✅ Valid Zibtek questions receive accurate answers  
✅ Out-of-scope questions are politely rejected  
✅ Prompt injection attempts are blocked  
✅ Conversations can be created, loaded, and deleted  
✅ All queries are logged in the database  
✅ Response times are acceptable (< 5 seconds)  
✅ System handles errors gracefully  
✅ Data persists across container restarts
